I admit it's not the best analogy since the train could just signal the direction with a flag. But in computers, the processor doesn't know which direction a branch will go until the last moment.</p>\n<p>So how would you strategically guess to minimize the number of times that the train must back up and go down the other path?

If it goes one way every three times, you guess the same...</p>\n<p><em><strong>In other words, you try to identify a pattern and follow it.</strong></em> This is more or less how branch predictors work.</p>\n<p>Most applications have well-behaved branches. So modern branch predictors will typically achieve &gt;90% hit rates.

When the data is sorted, roughly the first half of the iterations will not enter the if-statement. After that, they will all enter the if-statement.</p>\n<p>This is very friendly to the branch predictor since the branch consecutively goes the same direction many times. Even a simple saturating counter will correctly predict the branch except for the few iterations after it switches direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick visualization:</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>T = branch taken\nN = branch not taken\n\ndata[] = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, ... 250, 251, 252, ...\nbranch = N  N  N  N  N  ...

TTTTTTTTTT  (easy to predict)\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, when the data is completely random, the branch predictor is rendered useless, because it can't predict random data. Thus there will probably be around 50% misprediction (no better than random guessing).</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>data[] = 226, 185, 125, 158, 198, 144, 217, 79, 202, 118,  14, 150, 177, 182, ...\nbranch =   T,   T,   N,   T,   T,   T,   T,  N,   T,   N,   N,   T,   T,   T  ...\n\n       = TTNTTTTNTNNTTT ...

This type of branch can be easily transformed into a <strong>conditional move</strong> statement, which would be compiled into a conditional move instruction: <code>cmovl</code>, in an <code>x86</code> system. The branch and thus the potential branch prediction penalty is removed.</p>\n<p>In <code>C</code>, thus <code>C++</code>, the statement, which would compile directly (without any optimization) into the conditional move instruction in <code>x86</code>, is the ternary operator <code>... ? ... : ...</code>. So we rewrite the above statement into an equivalent one:</p>\n<pre><code>sum += data[c] &gt;=128 ? data[c] : 0;\n</code></pre>\n<p>While maintaining readability, we can check the speedup factor.</p>\n<p>On an Intel <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core#Core_i7\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Core i7</a>-2600K @ 3.4 GHz and Visual Studio 2010 Release Mode, the benchmark is:</p>\n<p><strong>x86</strong></p>\n<div class=\"s-table-container\">\n<table class=\"s-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Scenario</th>\n<th>Time (seconds)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Branching - Random data</td>\n<td>8.885</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Branching - Sorted data</td>\n<td>1.528</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Branchless - Random data</td>\n<td>3.716</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Branchless - Sorted data</td>\n<td>3.71</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><strong>x64</strong></p>\n<div class=\"s-table-container\">\n<table class=\"s-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Scenario</th>\n<th>Time (seconds)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Branching - Random data</td>\n<td>11.302</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Branching - Sorted data</td>\n<td>1.830</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Branchless - Random data</td>\n<td>2.736</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Branchless - Sorted data</td>\n<td>2.737</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>The result is robust in multiple tests. We get a great speedup when the branch result is unpredictable, but we suffer a little bit when it is predictable. In fact, when using a conditional move, the performance is the same regardless of the data pattern.</p>\n<p>Now let's look more closely by investigating the <code>x86</code> assembly they generate. For simplicity, we use two functions <code>max1</code> and <code>max2</code>.</p>\n<p><code>max1</code> uses the conditional branch <code>if... else ...</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>int max1(int a, int b) {\n    if (a &gt; b)\n        return a;\n    else\n        return b;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>max2</code> uses the ternary operator <code>... ? ... : ...</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>int max2(int a, int b) {\n    return a &gt; b ? a : b;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>On a x86-64 machine, <code>GCC -S</code> generates the assembly below.</p>\n<pre><code>:max1\n    movl    %edi, -4(%rbp)\n    movl    %esi, -8(%rbp)\n    movl    -4(%rbp), %eax\n    cmpl    -8(%rbp), %eax\n    jle     .L2\n    movl    -4(%rbp), %eax\n    movl    %eax, -12(%rbp)\n    jmp     .L4\n.L2:\n    movl    -8(%rbp), %eax\n    movl    %eax, -12(%rbp)\n.L4:\n    movl    -12(%rbp), %eax\n    leave\n    ret\n\n:max2\n    movl    %edi, -4(%rbp)\n    movl    %esi, -8(%rbp)\n    movl    -4(%rbp), %eax\n    cmpl    %eax, -8(%rbp)\n    cmovge  -8(%rbp), %eax\n    leave\n    ret\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>max2</code> uses much less code due to the usage of instruction <code>cmovge</code>. But the real gain is that <code>max2</code> does not involve branch jumps, <code>jmp</code>, which would have a significant performance penalty if the predicted result is not right.</p>\n<p>So why does a conditional move perform better?</p>\n<p>In a typical <code>x86</code> processor, the execution of an instruction is divided into several stages. Roughly, we have different hardware to deal with different stages. So we do not have to wait for one instruction to finish to start a new one. This is called <strong><a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pipelining</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>In a branch case, the following instruction is determined by the preceding one, so we cannot do pipelining. We have to either wait or predict.</p>\n<p>In a conditional move case, the execution conditional move instruction is divided into several stages, but the earlier stages like <code>Fetch</code> and <code>Decode</code> do not depend on the result of the previous instruction; only latter stages need the result. Thus, we wait a fraction of one instruction's execution time. This is why the conditional move version is slower than the branch when the prediction is easy.</p>\n<p>The book <em><a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0136108040\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, second edition</a></em> explains this in detail.

To compensate for the difference in speed, a couple of caches are built into your processor (L1/L2 cache). So imagine that you're doing your nice calculations and figure out that you need a piece of memory. The processor will get its 'load' operation and loads the piece of memory into cache -- and then uses the cache to do the rest of the calculations. Because memory is relatively slow, this 'load' will slow down your program.</p>\n\n<p>Like branch prediction, this was optimized in the Pentium processors: the processor predicts that it needs to load a piece of data and attempts to load that into the cache before the operation actually hits the cache. As we've already seen, branch prediction sometimes goes horribly wrong -- in the worst case scenario you need to go back and actually wait for a memory load, which will take forever (<strong>in other words: failing branch prediction is bad, a memory load after a branch prediction fail is just horrible!</strong>).</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately for us, if the memory access pattern is predictable, the processor will load it in its fast cache and all is well.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing we need to know is what is <em>small</em>? While smaller is generally better, a rule of thumb is to stick to lookup tables that are &lt;= 4096 bytes in size. As an upper limit: if your lookup table is larger than 64K it's probably worth reconsidering.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Constructing a table</strong></p>\n\n<p>So we've figured out that we can create a small table. Next thing to do is get a lookup function in place. Lookup functions are usually small functions that use a couple of basic integer operations (and, or, xor, shift, add, remove and perhaps multiply). You want to have your input translated by the lookup function to some kind of 'unique key' in your table, which then simply gives you the answer of all the work you wanted it to do.</p>\n\n<p>In this case: >= 128 means we can keep the value, &lt; 128 means we get rid of it. The easiest way to do that is by using an 'AND': if we keep it, we AND it with 7FFFFFFF; if we want to get rid of it, we AND it with 0. Notice also that 128 is a power of 2 -- so we can go ahead and make a table of 32768/128 integers and fill it with one zero and a lot of 7FFFFFFFF's.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Managed languages</strong></p>\n\n<p>You might wonder why this works well in managed languages. After all, managed languages check the boundaries of the arrays with a branch to ensure you don't mess up...</p>\n\n<p>Well, not exactly... :-)</p>\n\n<p>There has been quite some work on eliminating this branch for managed languages. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"lang-cs prettyprint-override\"><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.Length; ++i)\n{\n   // Use array[i]\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case, it's obvious to the compiler that the boundary condition will never be hit. At least the Microsoft JIT compiler (but I expect Java does similar things) will notice this and remove the check altogether. WOW, that means no branch. Similarly, it will deal with other obvious cases.</p>\n\n<p>If you run into trouble with lookups in managed languages -- the key is to add a <code>&amp; 0x[something]FFF</code> to your lookup function to make the boundary check predictable -- and watch it going faster.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The result of this case</strong></p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-cs prettyprint-override\"><code>// Generate data\nint arraySize = 32768;\nint[] data = new int[arraySize];\n\nRandom random = new Random(0);\nfor (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)\n{\n    data[c] = random.Next(256);\n}\n\n/*To keep the spirit of the code intact, I'll make a separate lookup table\n(I assume we cannot modify 'data' or the number of loops)*/\n\nint[] lookup = new int[256];\n\nfor (int c = 0; c &lt; 256; ++c)\n{\n    lookup[c] = (c &gt;= 128) ? c : 0;\n}\n\n// Test\nDateTime startTime = System.DateTime.Now;\nlong sum = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)\n{\n    // Primary loop\n    for (int j = 0; j &lt; arraySize; ++j)\n    {\n        /* Here you basically want to use simple operations - so no\n        random branches, but things like &amp;, |, *, -, +, etc. are fine. */\n        sum += lookup[data[j]];\n    }\n}\n\nDateTime endTime = System.DateTime.Now;\nConsole.WriteLine(endTime - startTime);\nConsole.WriteLine(\"sum = \" + sum);\nConsole.ReadLine();\n</code></pre>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":27352,"user_id":1031591,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s3MiH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"atlaste","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1031591/atlaste"},"edited":false,"score":35,"creation_date":1375099524,"post_id":17782979,"comment_id":26185793,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"Right, you can also just use the bit directly and multiply (<code>data[c]&gt;&gt;7</code> - which is discussed somewhere here as well); I intentionally left this solution out, but of course you are correct.

Stefan de Bruijn discussed that in his answer.</p>\n<p>But in this case, we know values are in the range [0, 255] and we only care about values &gt;= 128.  That means we can easily extract a single bit that will tell us whether we want a value or not: by shifting the data to the right 7 bits, we are left with a 0 bit or a 1 bit, and we only want to add the value when we have a 1 bit.  Let's call this bit the &quot;decision bit&quot;.</p>\n<p>By using the 0/1 value of the decision bit as an index into an array, we can make code that will be equally fast whether the data is sorted or not sorted.

It's tremendously faster on random data than the version with an actual if statement.</p>\n<p>But in my testing, an explicit lookup table was slightly faster than this, probably because indexing into a lookup table was slightly faster than bit shifting.  This shows how my code sets up and uses the lookup table (unimaginatively called <code>lut</code> for &quot;LookUp Table&quot; in the code).  Here's the C++ code:</p>\n<pre><code>// Declare and then fill in the lookup table\nint lut[256];\nfor (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; 256; ++c)\n    lut[c] = (c &gt;= 128) ? c : 0;\n\n// Use the lookup table after it is built\nfor (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)\n{\n    // Primary loop\n    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)\n    {\n        sum += lut[data[c]];\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, the lookup table was only 256 bytes, so it fits nicely in a cache and all was fast.  This technique wouldn't work well if the data was 24-bit values and we only wanted half of them... the lookup table would be far too big to be practical.  On the other hand, we can combine the two techniques shown above: first shift the bits over, then index a lookup table.  For a 24-bit value that we only want the top half value, we could potentially shift the data right by 12 bits, and be left with a 12-bit value for a table index.  A 12-bit table index implies a table of 4096 values, which might be practical.</p>\n<p>The technique of indexing into an array, instead of using an <code>if</code> statement, can be used for deciding which pointer to use.  I saw a library that implemented binary trees, and instead of having two named pointers (<code>pLeft</code> and <code>pRight</code> or whatever) had a length-2 array of pointers and used the &quot;decision bit&quot; technique to decide which one to follow.  For example, instead of:</p>\n<pre><code>if (x &lt; node-&gt;value)\n    node = node-&gt;pLeft;\nelse\n    node = node-&gt;pRight;\n</code></pre>\n<p>this library would do something like:</p>\n<pre><code>i = (x &lt; node-&gt;value);\nnode = node-&gt;link[i];\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here's a link to this code: <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190207151651/https://www.eternallyconfuzzled.com/tuts/datastructures/jsw_tut_rbtree.aspx\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Red Black Trees</a>, <em>Eternally Confuzzled</em></p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":322587,"user_id":85371,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d52c235ec6dd15f30bab444103e7af2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"sehe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/85371/sehe"},"edited":false,"score":27,"creation_date":1374683490,"post_id":17828251,"comment_id":26040119,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<code>sum= 3137536</code> - clever.

To understand this better please see this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)#Concept_and_motivation\" rel=\"noreferrer\">example on Wikipedia</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, modern processors have quite long pipelines, but for ease let's consider these 4 steps only.</p>\n\n<ol>  \n  <li>IF -- Fetch the instruction from memory \n  <li>ID -- Decode the instruction\n  <li>EX -- Execute the instruction \n  <li>WB -- Write back to CPU register\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong><em>4-stage pipeline in general for 2 instructions.</em></strong>\n<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PqBBR.png\" alt=\"4-stage pipeline in general\"></p>\n\n<p>Moving back to the above question let's consider the following instructions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>                        A) if (data[c] &gt;= 128)\n                                /\\\n                               /  \\\n                              /    \\\n                        true /      \\ false\n                            /        \\\n                           /          \\\n                          /            \\\n                         /              \\\n              B) sum += data[c];          C) for loop or print().\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Without branch prediction, the following would occur:</p>\n\n<p>To execute instruction B or instruction C the processor will have to wait till the instruction A doesn't reach till EX stage in the pipeline, as the decision to go to instruction B or instruction C depends on the result of instruction A.

It will not wait for the instruction A to reach the EX stage of the pipeline, but it will guess the decision and go to that instruction (B or C in case of our example).</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>In case of a correct guess, the pipeline looks something like this:</em></strong>\n<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZYUbs.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>If it is later detected that the guess was wrong then the partially executed instructions are discarded and the pipeline starts over with the correct branch, incurring a delay. \nThe time that is wasted in case of a branch misprediction is equal to the number of stages in the pipeline from the fetch stage to the execute stage. Modern microprocessors tend to have quite long pipelines so that the misprediction delay is between 10 and 20 clock cycles. The longer the pipeline the greater the need for a good <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor\" rel=\"noreferrer\">branch predictor</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the OP's code, the first time when the conditional, the branch predictor does not have any information to base up prediction, so the first time it will randomly choose the next instruction. Later in the for loop, it can base the prediction on the history. \nFor an array sorted in ascending order, there are three possibilities:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> All the elements are less than 128\n<li> All the elements are greater than 128\n<li> Some starting new elements are less than 128 and later it become greater than 128\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let us assume that the predictor will always assume the true branch on the first run.</p>\n\n<p>So in the first case, it will always take the true branch since historically all its predictions are correct.\nIn the 2nd case, initially it will predict wrong, but after a few iterations, it will predict correctly.\nIn the 3rd case, it will initially predict correctly till the elements are less than 128. After which it will fail for some time and the correct itself when it sees branch prediction failure in history. </p>\n\n<p>In all these cases the failure will be too less in number and as a result, only a few times it will need to discard the partially executed instructions and start over with the correct branch, resulting in fewer CPU cycles. </p>\n\n<p>But in case of a random unsorted array, the prediction will need to discard the partially executed instructions and start over with the correct branch most of the time and result in more CPU cycles compared to the sorted array.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":13524,"user_id":1313233,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hBeXC.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rkachach","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1313233/rkachach"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":743,"last_activity_date":1477650491,"last_edit_date":1477650491,"creation_date":1443020267,"answer_id":32742980,"question_id":11227809,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>In the same line (I think this was not highlighted by any answer) it's good to mention that sometimes (specially in software where the performance matters—like in the Linux kernel) you can find some if statements like the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (likely( everything_is_ok ))\n{\n    /* Do something */\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or similarly:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (unlikely(very_improbable_condition))\n{\n    /* Do something */    \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Both <code>likely()</code> and <code>unlikely()</code> are in fact macros that are defined by using something like the GCC's <code>__builtin_expect</code> to help the compiler insert prediction code to favour the condition taking into account the information provided by the user.

If these branches are inside loops and are hard to predict they can slow down execution significantly. Boolean variables are stored as 8-bit integers with the value <code>0</code> for <code>false</code> and <code>1</code> for <code>true</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Boolean variables are overdetermined in the sense that all operators that have Boolean variables as input check if the inputs have any other value than <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>, but operators that have Booleans as output can produce no other value than <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. This makes operations with Boolean variables as input less efficient than necessary.\nConsider example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool a, b, c, d;\nc = a &amp;&amp; b;\nd = a || b;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is typically implemented by the compiler in the following way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool a, b, c, d;\nif (a != 0) {\n    if (b != 0) {\n        c = 1;\n    }\n    else {\n        goto CFALSE;\n    }\n}\nelse {\n    CFALSE:\n    c = 0;\n}\nif (a == 0) {\n    if (b == 0) {\n        d = 0;\n    }\n    else {\n        goto DTRUE;\n    }\n}\nelse {\n    DTRUE:\n    d = 1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code is far from optimal. The branches may take a long time in case of mispredictions. The Boolean operations can be made much more efficient if it is known with certainty that the operands have no other values than <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. The reason why the compiler does not make such an assumption is that the variables might have other values if they are uninitialized or come from unknown sources. The above code can be optimized if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> has been initialized to valid values or if they come from operators that produce Boolean output. The optimized code looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>char a = 0, b = 1, c, d;\nc = a &amp; b;\nd = a | b;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>char</code> is used instead of <code>bool</code> in order to make it possible to use the bitwise operators (<code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code>) instead of the Boolean operators (<code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>). The bitwise operators are single instructions that take only one clock cycle. The OR operator (<code>|</code>) works even if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have other values than <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. The AND operator (<code>&amp;</code>) and the EXCLUSIVE OR operator (<code>^</code>) may give inconsistent results if the operands have other values than <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>.</p>\n\n<p><code>~</code> can not be used for NOT. Instead, you can make a Boolean NOT on a variable which is known to be <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> by XOR'ing it with <code>1</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool a, b;\nb = !a;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>can be optimized to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>char a = 0, b;\nb = a ^ 1;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>a &amp;&amp; b</code> cannot be replaced with <code>a &amp; b</code> if <code>b</code> is an expression that should not be evaluated if <code>a</code> is <code>false</code> ( <code>&amp;&amp;</code> will not evaluate <code>b</code>, <code>&amp;</code> will).

The\n  purpose of the branch predictor is to improve the flow in the\n  instruction pipeline. Branch predictors play a critical role in\n  achieving high effective performance in many modern pipelined\n  microprocessor architectures such as x86.</p>\n  \n  <p>Two-way branching is usually implemented with a conditional jump\n  instruction. A conditional jump can either be \"not taken\" and continue\n  execution with the first branch of code which follows immediately\n  after the conditional jump, or it can be \"taken\" and jump to a\n  different place in program memory where the second branch of code is\n  stored. It is not known for certain whether a conditional jump will be\n  taken or not taken until the condition has been calculated and the\n  conditional jump has passed the execution stage in the instruction\n  pipeline (see fig. 1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/unxnb.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/unxnb.png\" alt=\"figure 1\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Based on the described scenario, I have written an animation demo to show how instructions are executed in a pipeline in different situations.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Without the Branch Predictor. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Without branch prediction, the processor would have to wait until the\n  conditional jump instruction has passed the execute stage before the\n  next instruction can enter the fetch stage in the pipeline.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The example contains three instructions and the first one is a conditional jump instruction. The latter two instructions can go into the pipeline until the conditional jump instruction is executed. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GMFQ6.gif\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GMFQ6.gif\" alt=\"without branch predictor\"></a></p>\n\n<p>It will take 9 clock cycles for 3 instructions to be completed.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Use Branch Predictor and don't take a conditional jump.

Modern microprocessors tend to have quite long\n  pipelines so that the misprediction delay is between 10 and 20 clock\n  cycles. As a result, making a pipeline longer increases the need for a\n  more advanced branch predictor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see, it seems we don't have a reason not to use Branch Predictor.</p>\n\n<p>It's quite a simple demo that clarifies the very basic part of Branch Predictor.

This eliminates the need for short branches, and there would be no branch prediction hit for this algorithm. <b>Therefore, the sorted version of this algorithm would run slower than the unsorted version on ARM, because of the extra overhead of sorting.</b></p>\n<p>The inner loop for this algorithm would look something like the following in ARM assembly language:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>MOV R0, #0   // R0 = sum = 0\nMOV R1, #0   // R1 = c = 0\nADR R2, data // R2 = addr of data array (put this instruction outside outer loop)\n.inner_loop  // Inner loop branch label\n    LDRB R3, [R2, R1]   // R3 = data[c]\n    CMP R3, #128        // compare R3 to 128\n    ADDGE R0, R0, R3    // if R3 &gt;= 128, then sum += data[c] -- no branch needed!\n    ADD R1, R1, #1      // c++\n    CMP R1, #arraySize  // compare c to arraySize\n    BLT inner_loop      // Branch to inner_loop if c &lt; arraySize\n</code></pre>\n<p><em><strong>But this is actually part of a bigger picture:</strong></em></p>\n<p><code>CMP</code> opcodes always update the status bits in the Processor Status Register (PSR), because that is their purpose, but most other instructions do not touch the PSR unless you add an optional <code>S</code> suffix to the instruction, specifying that the PSR should be updated based on the result of the instruction. <strong>Just like the 4-bit condition suffix, being able to execute instructions without affecting the PSR is a mechanism that reduces the need for branches on ARM, and also facilitates out of order dispatch at the hardware level</strong>, because after performing some operation X that updates the status bits, subsequently (or in parallel) you can do a bunch of other work that explicitly should not affect (or be affected by) the status bits, then you can test the state of the status bits set earlier by X.</p>\n<p>The condition testing field and the optional &quot;set status bit&quot; field can be combined, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ADD R1, R2, R3</code> performs <code>R1 = R2 + R3</code> without updating any status bits.</li>\n<li><code>ADDGE R1, R2, R3</code> performs the same operation only if a previous instruction that affected the status bits resulted in a Greater than or Equal condition.</li>\n<li><code>ADDS R1, R2, R3</code> performs the addition and then updates the <code>N</code>, <code>Z</code>, <code>C</code> and <code>V</code> flags in the Processor Status Register based on whether the result was Negative, Zero, Carried (for unsigned addition), or oVerflowed (for signed addition).</li>\n<li><code>ADDSGE R1, R2, R3</code> performs the addition only if the <code>GE</code> test is true, and then subsequently updates the status bits based on the result of the addition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most processor architectures do not have this ability to specify whether or not the status bits should be updated for a given operation, which can necessitate writing additional code to save and later restore status bits, or may require additional branches, or may limit the processor's out of order execution efficiency: one of the side effects of most CPU instruction set architectures forcibly updating status bits after most instructions is that it is much harder to tease apart which instructions can be run in parallel without interfering with each other. Updating status bits has side effects, therefore has a linearizing effect on code. <strong>ARM's ability to mix and match branch-free condition testing on any instruction with the option to either update or not update the status bits after any instruction is extremely powerful, for both assembly language programmers and compilers, and produces very efficient code.</strong></p>\n<p>When you don't have to branch, you can avoid the time cost of flushing the pipeline for what would otherwise be short branches, and you can avoid the design complexity of many forms of speculative evalution. The performance impact of the initial naive imlementations of the mitigations for many recently discovered processor vulnerabilities (Spectre etc.) shows you just how much the performance of modern processors depends upon complex speculative evaluation logic. With a short pipeline and the dramatically reduced need for branching, ARM just doesn't need to rely on speculative evaluation as much as CISC processors. (Of course high-end ARM implementations do include speculative evaluation, but it's a smaller part of the performance story.)</p>\n<p>If you have ever wondered why ARM has been so phenomenally successful, the brilliant effectiveness and interplay of these two mechanisms (combined with another mechanism that lets you &quot;barrel shift&quot; left or right one of the two arguments of any arithmetic operator or offset memory access operator at zero additional cost) are a big part of the story, because they are some of the greatest sources of the ARM architecture's efficiency. The brilliance of the original designers of the ARM ISA back in 1983, Steve Furber and Roger (now Sophie) Wilson, cannot be overstated.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5792,"user_id":3950982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7491f45ae073ed6bfe01b1e63fb06bf0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Luke Hutchison","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3950982/luke-hutchison"},"edited":false,"score":4,"creation_date":1551356309,"post_id":53689911,"comment_id":96615671,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"I don&#39;t really see how this proves anything?

Basically at midnight at the end of 1927, the clocks went back 5 minutes and 52 seconds.

The test has now been changed, but it just goes to show - not even historical data is safe.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> History has changed again...</p>\n\n<p>In TZDB 2014f, the time of the change has moved to 1900-12-31, and it's now a mere 343 second change (so the time between <code>t</code> and <code>t+1</code> is 344 seconds, if you see what I mean).</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> To answer a question around a transition at 1900... it looks like the Java timezone implementation treats <em>all</em> time zones as simply being in their standard time for any instant before the start of 1900 UTC:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.util.TimeZone;\n\npublic class Test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        long startOf1900Utc = -2208988800000L;\n        for (String id : TimeZone.getAvailableIDs()) {\n            TimeZone zone = TimeZone.getTimeZone(id);\n            if (zone.getRawOffset() != zone.getOffset(startOf1900Utc - 1)) {\n                System.out.println(id);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The code above produces no output on my Windows machine. So any time zone which has any offset other than its standard one at the start of 1900 will count that as a transition. TZDB itself has some data going back earlier than that, and doesn't rely on any idea of a \"fixed\" standard time (which is what <code>getRawOffset</code> assumes to be a valid concept) so other libraries needn't introduce this artificial transition.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":22874,"user_id":181106,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9503d8699f2f4e733131d4e025990483?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"uckelman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/181106/uckelman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1606517832,"post_id":6841572,"comment_id":114993233,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"It happens twice a year anywhere that observes DST."}],"owner":{"reputation":324869,"user_id":16883,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0382297f273df0a544b0c6c2734de096?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michael Borgwardt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/16883/michael-borgwardt"},"comment_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1659,"last_activity_date":1311755931,"creation_date":1311755931,"answer_id":6841572,"question_id":6841333,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>You've encountered a <a href=\"http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/clockchange.html?n=237&amp;year=1927\" rel=\"noreferrer\">local time discontinuity</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When local standard time was about to reach Sunday, 1.

There are two possible timezone offsets for <code>1927-12-31 23:54:08</code> at <code>Asia/Shanghai</code>, but only one offset for <code>1927-12-31 23:54:07</code>. So, depending on which offset is used, there's either a one second difference or a 5 minutes and 53 seconds difference.</p>\n\n<p>This slight shift of offsets, instead of the usual one-hour daylight savings (summer time) we are used to, obscures the problem a bit.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the 2013a update of the timezone database moved this discontinuity a few seconds earlier, but the effect would still be observable.</p>\n\n<p>The new <code>java.time</code> package on Java 8 let use see this more clearly, and provide tools to handle it. Given:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DateTimeFormatterBuilder dtfb = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder();\ndtfb.append(DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_DATE);\ndtfb.appendLiteral(' ');\ndtfb.append(DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_TIME);\nDateTimeFormatter dtf = dtfb.toFormatter();\nZoneId shanghai = ZoneId.of(\"Asia/Shanghai\");\n\nString str3 = \"1927-12-31 23:54:07\";  \nString str4 = \"1927-12-31 23:54:08\";  \n\nZonedDateTime zdt3 = LocalDateTime.parse(str3, dtf).atZone(shanghai);\nZonedDateTime zdt4 = LocalDateTime.parse(str4, dtf).atZone(shanghai);\n\nDuration durationAtEarlierOffset = Duration.between(zdt3.withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap(), zdt4.withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap());\n\nDuration durationAtLaterOffset = Duration.between(zdt3.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap(), zdt4.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then <code>durationAtEarlierOffset</code> will be one second, while <code>durationAtLaterOffset</code> will be five minutes and 53 seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Also, these two offsets are the same:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Both have offsets +08:05:52\nZoneOffset zo3Earlier = zdt3.withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap().getOffset();\nZoneOffset zo3Later = zdt3.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap().getOffset();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But these two are different:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// +08:05:52\nZoneOffset zo4Earlier = zdt4.withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap().getOffset();\n\n// +08:00\nZoneOffset zo4Later = zdt4.withLaterOffsetAtOverlap().getOffset();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can see the same problem comparing <code>1927-12-31 23:59:59</code> with <code>1928-01-01 00:00:00</code>, though, in this case, it is the earlier offset that produces the longer divergence, and it is the earlier date that has two possible offsets.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to approach this is to check whether there's a transition going on. We can do this like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Null\nZoneOffsetTransition zot3 = shanghai.getRules().getTransition(ld3.toLocalDateTime);\n\n// An overlap transition\nZoneOffsetTransition zot4 = shanghai.getRules().getTransition(ld3.toLocalDateTime);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can check whether the transition is an overlap where there's more than one valid offset for that date/time or a gap where that date/time is not valid for that zone id - by using the <code>isOverlap()</code> and <code>isGap()</code> methods on <code>zot4</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps people handle this sort of issue once Java 8 becomes widely available, or to those using Java 7 who adopt the JSR 310 backport.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":9247,"user_id":1050755,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":51,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c944828c87e2f4809621a6087beaa8b1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1050755","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1050755/user1050755"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":237,"last_activity_date":1545006682,"last_edit_date":1545006682,"creation_date":1392677052,"answer_id":21840785,"question_id":6841333,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"<p>I'm sorry to say, but the time discontinuity has moved a bit in</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_6_.28December_11.2C_2006.29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JDK 6</a> two years ago, and in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_7_.28July_28.2C_2011.29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JDK 7</a> just recently in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#cite_note-131\" rel=\"noreferrer\">update 25</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Lesson to learn: avoid non-UTC times at all costs, except maybe for display.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":9247,"user_id":1050755,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":51,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c944828c87e2f4809621a6087beaa8b1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1050755","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1050755/user1050755"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":175,"last_activity_date":1603165257,"last_edit_date":1603165257,"creation_date":1417017497,"answer_id":27153569,"question_id":6841333,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"<p><code>IMHO</code> the pervasive, <em>implicit</em> localization in Java is its single largest design flaw.

Then Java has objects (everything that derives from <code>java.lang.Object</code>). Objects are actually always handled through a reference (a reference being a pointer that you can't touch). That means that in effect, objects are passed by reference, as the references are normally not interesting. It does however mean that you cannot change which object is pointed to as the reference itself is passed by value.</p>\n\n<p>Does this sound strange and confusing? Let's consider how C implements pass by reference and pass by value. In C, the default convention is pass by value. <code>void foo(int x)</code> passes an int by value. <code>void foo(int *x)</code> is a function that does not want an <code>int a</code>, but a pointer to an int: <code>foo(&amp;a)</code>. One would use this with the <code>&amp;</code> operator to pass a variable address.</p>\n\n<p>Take this to C++, and we have references. References are basically (in this context) syntactic sugar that hide the pointer part of the equation: <code>void foo(int &amp;x)</code> is called by <code>foo(a)</code>, where the compiler itself knows that it is a reference and the address of the non-reference <code>a</code> should be passed. In Java, all variables referring to objects are actually of reference type, in effect forcing call by reference for most intends and purposes without the fine grained control (and complexity) afforded by, for example, C++.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":26648,"user_id":292,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16db4bb794911afb2830e17e6c9d4702?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"shsteimer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/292/shsteimer"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1347646975,"score":43,"last_activity_date":1398833416,"last_edit_date":1398833416,"creation_date":1220470923,"answer_id":42392,"question_id":40480,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>The distinction, or perhaps just the way I remember as I used to be under the same impression as the original poster is this: Java is always pass by value.

This means we pass 42 to the method.</p>\n\n<p>if the Method were defined as</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void foo(Dog someDog) {\n    someDog.setName(\"Max\");     // AAA\n    someDog = new Dog(\"Fifi\");  // BBB\n    someDog.setName(\"Rowlf\");   // CCC\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>let's look at what's happening.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the parameter <code>someDog</code> is set to the value 42</li>\n<li>at line \"AAA\"\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>someDog</code> is followed to the <code>Dog</code> it points to (the <code>Dog</code> object at address 42)</li>\n<li>that <code>Dog</code> (the one at address 42) is asked to change his name to Max</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>at line \"BBB\"\n\n<ul>\n<li>a new <code>Dog</code> is created.

You can assign a pointer, pass the pointer to a method, follow the pointer in the method and change the data that was pointed to. However, you cannot change where that pointer points.</p>\n\n<p>In C++, Ada, Pascal and other languages that support pass-by-reference, you can actually change the variable that was passed.</p>\n\n<p>If Java had pass-by-reference semantics, the <code>foo</code> method we defined above would have changed where <code>myDog</code> was pointing when it assigned <code>someDog</code> on line BBB.</p>\n\n<p>Think of reference parameters as being aliases for the variable passed in.

Consider the following bit of code in C++:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void getValues(int&amp; arg1, int&amp; arg2) {\n    arg1 = 1;\n    arg2 = 2;\n}\nvoid caller() {\n    int x;\n    int y;\n    getValues(x, y);\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"Result: \" &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; \" \" &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; endl;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sometimes you want to use the same pattern in Java, but you can't; at least not directly. Instead you could do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void getValues(int[] arg1, int[] arg2) {\n    arg1[0] = 1;\n    arg2[0] = 2;\n}\nvoid caller() {\n    int[] x = new int[1];\n    int[] y = new int[1];\n    getValues(x, y);\n    System.out.println(\"Result: \" + x[0] + \" \" + y[0]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As was explained in previous answers, in Java you're passing a pointer to the array as a value into <code>getValues</code>. That is enough, because the method then modifies the array element, and by convention you're expecting element 0 to contain the return value. Obviously you can do this in other ways, such as structuring your code so this isn't necessary, or constructing a class that can contain the return value or allow it to be set. But the simple pattern available to you in C++ above is not available in Java.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":4606,"user_id":48402,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5c8f5e525d9fa687c10f3bc5ab4b42b5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kukudas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/48402/kukudas"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1347646975,"score":58,"last_activity_date":1238695124,"last_edit_date":1238695124,"creation_date":1238621600,"answer_id":707416,"question_id":40480,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 2.5","body":"<p>As far as I know, Java only knows call by value. This means for primitive datatypes you will work with an copy and for objects you will work with an copy of the reference to the objects. However I think there are some pitfalls; for example, this will not work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void swap(StringBuffer s1, StringBuffer s2) {\n    StringBuffer temp = s1;\n    s1 = s2;\n    s2 = temp;\n}\n\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    StringBuffer s1 = new StringBuffer(\"Hello\");\n    StringBuffer s2 = new StringBuffer(\"World\");\n    swap(s1, s2);\n    System.out.println(s1);\n    System.out.println(s2);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will populate Hello World and not World Hello because in the swap function you use copys which have no impact on the references in the main. But if your objects are not immutable you can change it for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void appendWorld(StringBuffer s1) {\n    s1.append(\" World\");\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    StringBuffer s = new StringBuffer(\"Hello\");\n    appendWorld(s);\n    System.out.println(s);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will populate Hello World on the command line. If you change StringBuffer into String it will produce just Hello because String is immutable. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void appendWorld(String s){\n    s = s+\" World\";\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String s = new String(\"Hello\");\n    appendWorld(s);\n    System.out.println(s);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However you could make a wrapper for String like this which would make it able to use it with Strings:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class StringWrapper {\n    public String value;\n\n    public StringWrapper(String value) {\n        this.value = value;\n    }\n}\n\npublic static void appendWorld(StringWrapper s){\n    s.value = s.value +\" World\";\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    StringWrapper s = new StringWrapper(\"Hello\");\n    appendWorld(s);\n    System.out.println(s.value);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>edit: i believe this is also the reason to use StringBuffer when it comes to \"adding\" two Strings because you can modifie the original object which u can't with immutable objects like String is.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":238938,"user_type":"unregistered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0a190604dc3dd2ee7b66bb95c20ef7f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rusty Shackleford","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/238938/rusty-shackleford"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1347646975,"score":28,"last_activity_date":1261858762,"creation_date":1261858762,"answer_id":1964260,"question_id":40480,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 2.5","body":"<p>A few corrections to some posts.</p>\n\n<p>C does NOT support pass by reference.

This is from the guide that is made to pass the Sun/Oracle test on the behaviour of Java so it's a good source to use for this discussion.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Passing Variables into Methods (Objective 7.3)</p>\n  \n  <p>7.3 Determine the effect upon object references and primitive values when they are passed into methods that perform assignments or other modifying operations on the parameters.</p>\n  \n  <p>Methods can be declared to take primitives and/or object references. You need to know how (or if) the caller's variable can be affected by the called method. The difference between object reference and primitive variables, when passed into methods, is huge and important. To understand this section, you'll need to be comfortable with the assignments section covered in the first part of this chapter.</p>\n  \n  <p>Passing Object Reference Variables</p>\n  \n  <p>When you pass an object variable into a method, you must keep in mind that you're passing the object reference, and not the actual object itself. Remember that a reference variable holds bits that represent (to the underlying VM) a way to get to a specific object in memory (on the heap). More importantly, you must remember that you aren't even passing the actual reference variable, but rather a copy of the reference variable. A copy of a variable means you get a copy of the bits in that variable, so when you pass a reference variable, you're passing a copy of the bits representing how to get to a specific object. In other words, both the caller and the called method will now have identical copies of the reference, and thus both will refer to the same exact (not a copy) object on the heap.</p>\n  \n  <p>For this example, we'll use the Dimension class from the java.awt package:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>1. import java.awt.Dimension;\n2. class ReferenceTest {\n3.     public static void main (String [] args) {\n4.         Dimension d = new Dimension(5,10);\n5.         ReferenceTest rt = new ReferenceTest();\n6.         System.out.println(\"Before modify() d.height = \" + d.height);\n7.         rt.modify(d);\n8.         System.out.println(\"After modify() d.height = \"\n9.     }\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.   }\n14. }\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When we run this class, we can see that the modify() method was indeed able to modify the original (and only) Dimension object created on line 4.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre>\nC:\\Java Projects\\Reference>java ReferenceTest\nBefore modify() d.height = 10\ndim = 11\nAfter modify() d.height = 11\n</pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Notice when the Dimension object on line 4 is passed to the modify() method, any changes to the object that occur inside the method are being made to the object whose reference was passed. In the preceding example, reference variables d and dim both point to the same object.</p>\n  \n  <p>Does Java Use Pass-By-Value Semantics?</p>\n  \n  <p>If Java passes objects by passing the reference variable instead, does that mean Java uses pass-by-reference for objects? Not exactly, although you'll often hear and read that it does. Java is actually pass-by-value for all variables running within a single VM. Pass-by-value means pass-by-variable-value. And that means, pass-by-copy-of- the-variable! (There's that word copy again!)</p>\n  \n  <p>It makes no difference if you're passing primitive or reference variables, you are always passing a copy of the bits in the variable. So for a primitive variable, you're passing a copy of the bits representing the value. For example, if you pass an int variable with the value of 3, you're passing a copy of the bits representing 3. The called method then gets its own copy of the value, to do with it what it likes.</p>\n  \n  <p>And if you're passing an object reference variable, you're passing a copy of the bits representing the reference to an object. The called method then gets its own copy of the reference variable, to do with it what it likes. But because two identical reference variables refer to the exact same object, if the called method modifies the object (by invoking setter methods, for example), the caller will see that the object the caller's original variable refers to has also been changed. In the next section, we'll look at how the picture changes when we're talking about primitives.</p>\n  \n  <p>The bottom line on pass-by-value: the called method can't change the caller's variable, although for object reference variables, the called method can change the object the variable referred to. What's the difference between changing the variable and changing the object? For object references, it means the called method can't reassign the caller's original reference variable and make it refer to a different object, or null. For example, in the following code fragment,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>        void bar() {\n           Foo f = new Foo();\n           doStuff(f);\n        }\n        void doStuff(Foo g) {\n           g.setName(\"Boo\");\n           g = new Foo();\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>reassigning g does not reassign f! At the end of the bar() method, two Foo objects have been created, one referenced by the local variable f and one referenced by\n  the local (argument) variable g. Because the doStuff() method has a copy of the reference variable, it has a way to get to the original Foo object, for instance to call the setName() method. But, the doStuff() method does not have a way to get to the f reference variable. So doStuff() can change values within the object f refers to, but doStuff() can't change the actual contents (bit pattern) of f. In other words, doStuff() can change the state of the object that f refers to, but it can't make f refer to a different object!</p>\n  \n  <p>Passing Primitive Variables</p>\n  \n  <p>Let's look at what happens when a primitive variable is passed to a method:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>class ReferenceTest {\n    public static void main (String [] args) {\n      int a = 1;\n      ReferenceTest rt = new ReferenceTest();\n      System.out.println(\"Before modify() a = \" + a);\n      rt.modify(a);\n      System.out.println(\"After modify() a = \" + a);\n    }\n    void modify(int number) {\n      number = number + 1;\n      System.out.println(\"number = \" + number);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In this simple program, the variable a is passed to a method called modify(),\n  which increments the variable by 1. The resulting output looks like this:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>  Before modify() a = 1\n  number = 2\n  After modify() a = 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Notice that a did not change after it was passed to the method.

Here's some additional information that will hopefully aid in understanding what's happening in memory.</p>\n\n<p>Crash course on stack/heap before we get to the Java implementation:\nValues go on and off the stack in a nice orderly fashion, like a stack of plates at a cafeteria.\nMemory in the heap (also known as dynamic memory) is haphazard and disorganized. The JVM just finds space wherever it can, and frees it up as the variables that use it are no longer needed.</p>\n\n<p>Okay. First off, local primitives go on the stack. So this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int x = 3;\nfloat y = 101.1f;\nboolean amIAwesome = true;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>results in this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7nGKU.png\" alt=\"primitives on the stack\"></p>\n\n<p>When you declare and instantiate an object. The actual object goes on the heap. What goes on the stack? The address of the object on the heap. C++ programmers would call this a pointer, but some Java developers are against the word \"pointer\". Whatever. Just know that the address of the object goes on the stack.</p>\n\n<p>Like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int problems = 99;\nString name = \"Jay-Z\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yTIYp.png\" alt=\"a b*7ch aint one!\"></p>\n\n<p>An array is an object, so it goes on the heap as well. And what about the objects in the array? They get their own heap space, and the address of each object goes inside the array.</p>\n\n<pre><code>JButton[] marxBros = new JButton[3];\nmarxBros[0] = new JButton(\"Groucho\");\nmarxBros[1] = new JButton(\"Zeppo\");\nmarxBros[2] = new JButton(\"Harpo\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v2b33.png\" alt=\"marx brothers\"></p>\n\n<p>So, what gets passed in when you call a method? If you pass in an object, what you're actually passing in is the address of the object. Some might say the \"value\" of the address, and some say it's just a reference to the object. This is the genesis of the holy war between \"reference\" and \"value\" proponents. What you call it isn't as important as that you understand that what's getting passed in is the address to the object.</p>\n\n<pre><code>private static void shout(String name){\n    System.out.println(\"There goes \" + name + \"!\");\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args){\n    String hisName = \"John J. Jingleheimerschmitz\";\n    String myName = hisName;\n    shout(myName);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>One String gets created and space for it is allocated in the heap, and the address to the string is stored on the stack and given the identifier <code>hisName</code>, since the address of the second String is the same as the first, no new String is created and no new heap space is allocated, but a new identifier is created on the stack. Then we call <code>shout()</code>: a new stack frame is created and a new identifier, <code>name</code> is created and assigned the address of the already-existing String.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/q0prc.png\" alt=\"la da di da da da da\"></p>\n\n<p>So, value, reference?

Since it is <strong>passing by value</strong>, it passes a copy of the variable rather than the actual reference of it. Since we said the value of t was <code>0x100234</code>, both t and f will have the same value and hence they will point to the same object.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WwdPh.png\" alt=\"second illustration\" /></p>\n<p>If you change anything in the function using reference f it will modify the existing contents of the object.

No, because it only passes a copy of the reference.\nIn the case of passing by reference, it could have thrown a <code>NullPointerException</code>, as seen below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jH6KP.png\" alt=\"third illustration\" /></p>\n<p>Hopefully this will help.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":107659,"user_id":179850,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b2c535fac79e482b71f15de561f55ca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gray","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/179850/gray"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1511901234,"post_id":19970416,"comment_id":82037935,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"This is very misleading.

At the CPU level a <em>reference</em> to anything immediately becomes a <em>value</em> if it gets written to memory or to one of the CPU registers. (That is why <em>pointer</em> is a good definition. It is a value, which has a purpose at the same time).</p>\n\n<p>Data in memory has a <strong>Location</strong> and at that location there is a value (byte,word, whatever). In Assembly we have a convenient solution to give a <strong>Name</strong> to certain <strong>Location</strong> (aka variable), but when compiling the code, the assembler simply replaces <strong>Name</strong> with the designated location just like your browser replaces domain names with IP addresses.</p>\n\n<p>Down to the core it is technically impossible to pass a reference to anything in any language without representing it (when it immediately becomes a value).</p>\n\n<p>Lets say we have a variable Foo, its <strong>Location</strong> is at the 47th byte in memory and its <strong>Value</strong> is 5. We have another variable <strong>Ref2Foo</strong> which is at 223rd byte in memory, and its value will be 47. This Ref2Foo might be a technical variable, not explicitly created by the program. If you just look at 5 and 47 without any other information, you will see just two <strong>Values</strong>.\nIf you use them as references then to reach to <code>5</code> we have to travel:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(Name)[Location] -&gt; [Value at the Location]\n---------------------\n(Ref2Foo)[223]  -&gt; 47\n(Foo)[47]       -&gt; 5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is how jump-tables work. </p>\n\n<p>If we want to call a method/function/procedure with Foo's value, there are a few possible way to pass the variable to the method, depending on the <strong>language</strong> and its several method invocation modes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>5 gets copied to one of the CPU registers (ie. EAX).</li>\n<li>5 gets PUSHd to the stack.</li>\n<li>47 gets copied to one of the CPU registers</li>\n<li>47 PUSHd to the stack.</li>\n<li>223 gets copied to one of the CPU registers.</li>\n<li>223 gets PUSHd to the stack.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In every cases above a value - a <strong>copy</strong> of an existing value - has been created, it is now upto the receiving method to handle it. When you write \"Foo\" inside the method, it is either read out from EAX, or automatically  <strong>dereferenced</strong>, or double dereferenced, the process depends on how the language works and/or what the type of Foo dictates. This is hidden from the developer until she circumvents the dereferencing process. So a <em>reference</em> is a <em>value</em> when represented, because a reference is a value that has to be processed (at language level).</p>\n\n<p>Now we have passed Foo to the method:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>in case 1. and 2. if you change Foo (<code>Foo = 9</code>) it only affects local scope as you have a copy of the Value. From inside the method we cannot even determine where in memory the original Foo was located.</li>\n<li>in case 3. and 4. if you use default language constructs and change Foo (<code>Foo = 11</code>), it could change Foo globally (depends on the language, ie. Java or like Pascal's <code>procedure findMin(x, y, z: integer;</code><strong>var m</strong><code>: integer);</code>). However if the language allows you to circumvent the dereference process, you can change <code>47</code>, say to <code>49</code>. At that point Foo seems to have been changed if you read it, because you have changed the <strong>local pointer</strong> to it. And if you were to modify this Foo inside the method (<code>Foo = 12</code>) you will probably FUBAR the execution of the program (aka. segfault) because you will write to a different memory than expected, you can even modify an area that is destined to hold executable program and writing to it will modify running code (Foo is now not at <code>47</code>). BUT Foo's value of <code>47</code> did not change globally, only the one inside the method, because <code>47</code> was also a copy to the method.</li>\n<li>in case 5. and 6. if you modify <code>223</code> inside the method it creates the same mayhem as in 3. or 4. (a pointer, pointing to a now bad value, that is again used as a pointer) but this is still a local problem, as 223 was <strong>copied</strong>. However if you are able to dereference <code>Ref2Foo</code> (that is <code>223</code>), reach to and modify the pointed value <code>47</code>, say, to <code>49</code>, it will affect Foo <strong>globally</strong>, because in this case the methods got a copy of <code>223</code>  but the referenced <code>47</code> exists only once, and changing that to <code>49</code> will lead every <code>Ref2Foo</code> double-dereferencing to a wrong value.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Nitpicking on insignificant details, even languages that do pass-by-reference will pass values to functions, but those functions know that they have to use it for dereferencing purposes. This pass-the-reference-as-value is just hidden from the programmer because it is practically useless and the terminology is only <em>pass-by-reference</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Strict <em>pass-by-value</em> is also useless, it would mean that a 100 Mbyte array should have to be copied every time we call a method with the array as argument, therefore Java cannot be stricly pass-by-value. Every language would pass a reference to this huge array (as a value) and either employs copy-on-write mechanism if that array can be changed locally inside the method or allows the method (as Java does) to modify the array globally (from the caller's view) and a few languages allows to modify the Value of the reference itself.</p>\n\n<p>So in short and in Java's own terminology, Java is <em>pass-by-value</em> where <em>value</em> can be: either a <strong>real value</strong> or a <strong>value</strong> that is a representation of a <strong>reference</strong>. </p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":18222,"user_id":779111,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/808763efea1a993c937ac96e7e83032f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"JAN","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/779111/jan"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1390407794,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1398833700,"last_edit_date":1398833700,"creation_date":1390407794,"answer_id":21288385,"question_id":40480,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>Mr @Scott Stanchfield wrote an excellent answer.

It's important to understand that these are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Industry Terms</a>, and cannot be correctly understood outside of that context. They are meant to help you as you code and are valuable to understand, so let's first go over what they mean. </p>\n\n<p>A good description of both can be found <a href=\"http://cplus.about.com/od/glossar1/g/passbyrefdefn.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pass By Value</strong> The value the function received is a copy of the object the caller is using. It is entirely unique to the function and anything you do to that object will only be seen within the function.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pass By Reference</strong> The value the function received is a reference to the object the caller is using. Anything the function does to the object that value refers to will be seen by the caller and it will be working with those changes from that point on.</p>\n\n<p>As is clear from those definitions, the fact that the reference is passed by value is irrelevant. If we were to accept that definition, then these terms become meaningless and all languages everywhere are only Pass By Value.</p>\n\n<p>No matter how you pass the reference in, it can only ever be passed by value. That isn't the point. The point is that you passed a reference to your own object to the function, not a copy of it. The fact that you can throw away the reference you received is irrelevant. Again, if we accepted that definition, these terms become meaningless and everyone is always passing by value.</p>\n\n<p>And no, C++'s special \"pass by reference\" syntax is not the exclusive definition of pass by reference. It is purely a convenience syntax meant to make it so that you don't need to use pointer syntax after passing the pointer in. It is still passing a pointer, the compiler is just hiding that fact from you. It also still passes that pointer BY VALUE, the compiler is just hiding that from you.</p>\n\n<p>So, with this understanding, we can look at Java and see that it actually has both. All Java primitive types are always pass by value because you receive a copy of the caller's object and cannot modify their copy. All Java reference types are always pass by reference because you receive a reference to the caller's object and can directly modify their object. </p>\n\n<p>The fact that you cannot modify the caller's reference has nothing to do with pass by reference and is true in every language that supports pass by reference.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8358,"user_id":2067492,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54af3ad01b032767b05a7e98fede6d6e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"matt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2067492/matt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1465978440,"post_id":37669835,"comment_id":63121427,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"Is there an issue in your c++ version where your risking a segfault when <code>Foo(99)</code> goes out of scope but you reference it in your main method?"},{"owner":{"reputation":447,"user_id":1195605,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1c0c6dd89063aab67029880f16afb019?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ravi Sanwal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1195605/ravi-sanwal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8358,"user_id":2067492,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54af3ad01b032767b05a7e98fede6d6e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"matt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2067492/matt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1466090219,"post_id":37669835,"comment_id":63183509,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"Indeed.

However, Java doesn't pass method arguments by reference; it passes them by value.</p>\n\n<p>Take the badSwap() method for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public void badSwap(int var1, int\n var2{ int temp = var1; var1 = var2; var2 =\n temp; }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When badSwap() returns, the variables passed as arguments will still hold their original values. The method will also fail if we change the arguments type from int to Object, since Java passes object references by value as well. Now, here is where it gets tricky:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void tricky(Point arg1, Point   arg2)\n{ arg1.x = 100; arg1.y = 100; Point temp = arg1; arg1 = arg2; arg2 = temp; }\npublic static void main(String [] args) { \n\n Point pnt1 = new Point(0,0); Point pnt2\n = new Point(0,0); System.out.println(\"X:\n \" + pnt1.x + \" Y: \" +pnt1.y);\n\n     System.out.println(\"X: \" + pnt2.x + \" Y:\n \" +pnt2.y); System.out.println(\" \");\n\n     tricky(pnt1,pnt2);\n System.out.println(\"X: \" + pnt1.x + \" Y:\" + pnt1.y);\n\n     System.out.println(\"X: \" + pnt2.x + \" Y: \" +pnt2.y); }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If we execute this main() method, we see the following output:</p>\n\n<p>X: 0 Y: 0 X: 0 Y: 0 X: 100 Y: 100 X: 0 Y: 0</p>\n\n<p>The method successfully alters the value ofpnt1, even though it is passed by value; however, a swap of pnt1 and pnt2 fails! This is the major source of confusion. In themain() method, pnt1 and pnt2 are nothing more than object references. When you passpnt1 and pnt2 to the tricky() method, Java passes the references by value just like any other parameter. This means the references passed to the method are actually copies of the original references. Figure 1 below shows two references pointing to the same object after Java passes an object to a method.</p>\n\n<p>Java copies and passes the reference by value, not the object. Thus, method manipulation will alter the objects, since the references point to the original objects. But since the references are copies, swaps will fail. As Figure 2 illustrates, the method references swap, but not the original references. Unfortunately, after a method call, you are left with only the unswapped original references. For a swap to succeed outside of the method call, we need to swap the original references, not the copies.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1822,"user_id":369604,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/613ba412b35c0d51e4de306d92858bd4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Loduwijk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/369604/loduwijk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1501687539,"post_id":39767073,"comment_id":77890692,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"You might want to clarify your last sentence.

Also, since Java is (mostly) object-oriented and objects work with references, it's easy to get confused and think of it to be \"pass by reference\"</p>\n\n<p>Pass by value means you pass the value to the method and if the method changes the passed value, the real entity doesn't change. Pass by reference, on the other hand, means a reference is passed to the method, and if the method changes it, the passed object also changes.</p>\n\n<p>In Java, usually when we pass an object to a method, we basically pass the reference of the object as-a-value because that's how Java works; it works with references and addresses as far as Object in the heap goes.</p>\n\n<p>But to test if it is really pass by value or pass by reference, you can use a primitive type and references:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Test\npublic void sampleTest(){\n    int i = 5;\n    incrementBy100(i);\n    System.out.println(\"passed ==&gt; \"+ i);\n    Integer j = new Integer(5);\n    incrementBy100(j);\n    System.out.println(\"passed ==&gt; \"+ j);\n}\n/**\n * @param i\n */\nprivate void incrementBy100(int i) {\n    i += 100;\n    System.out.println(\"incremented = \"+ i);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The output is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>incremented = 105\npassed ==&gt; 5\nincremented = 105\npassed ==&gt; 5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So in both cases, whatever happens inside the method doesn't change the real Object, because the value of that object was passed, and not a reference to the object itself.</p>\n\n<p>But when you pass a custom object to a method, and the method and changes it, it will change the real object too, because even when you passed the object, you passed it's reference as a value to the method. Let's try another example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Test\npublic void sampleTest2(){\n    Person person = new Person(24, \"John\");\n    System.out.println(person);\n    alterPerson(person);\n    System.out.println(person);\n}\n\n/**\n * @param person\n */\nprivate void alterPerson(Person person) {\n    person.setAge(45);\n    Person altered = person;\n    altered.setName(\"Tom\");\n}\n\nprivate static class Person{\n    private int age;\n    private String name; \n\n    public Person(int age, String name) {\n        this.age=age;\n        this.name =name;\n    }\n\n    public int getAge() {\n        return age;\n    }\n\n    public void setAge(int age) {\n        this.age = age;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public void setName(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();\n        builder.append(\"Person [age=\");\n        builder.append(age);\n        builder.append(\", name=\");\n        builder.append(name);\n        builder.append(\"]\");\n        return builder.toString();\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case, the output is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Person [age=24, name=John]\nPerson [age=45, name=Tom]\n</code></pre>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":806,"user_id":1952852,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8dfa92044d56ff2a1fe5df317fd19790?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Raja","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1952852/raja"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1485546707,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1485547813,"last_edit_date":1485547813,"creation_date":1485546707,"answer_id":41901960,"question_id":40480,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>I tried to simplify the examples above, keeping only the essense of the problem.\nLet me present this as a story that is easy to remember and apply correctly.\nThe story goes like this:\nYou have a pet dog, Jimmy, whose tail is 12 inches long.\nYou leave it with a vet for a few weeks while you are travelling abroad.</p>\n\n<p>The vet doesn't like the long tail of Jimmy, so he wants to cut it by half.\nBut being a good vet, he knows that he has no right to mutilate other people's dogs.\nSo he first makes a clone of the dog (with the <em>new</em> key word) and cuts the tail of the clone.\nWhen the dog finally returns to you, it has the original 12 inch tail in tact.

This is because Java is passed by value, this swap() method test can be used with any programming language to check whether it’s pass by value or pass by reference.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s analyze the program execution step by step.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Balloon red = new Balloon(\"Red\");\nBalloon blue = new Balloon(\"Blue\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When we use the new operator to create an instance of a class, the instance is created and the variable contains the reference location of the memory where the object is saved. For our example, let’s assume that “red” is pointing to 50 and “blue” is pointing to 100 and these are the memory location of both Balloon objects.</p>\n\n<p>Now when we are calling swap() method, two new variables o1 and o2 are created pointing to 50 and 100 respectively.</p>\n\n<p>So below code snippet explains what happened in the swap() method execution.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void swap(Object o1, Object o2){ //o1=50, o2=100\n    Object temp = o1; //temp=50, o1=50, o2=100\n    o1=o2; //temp=50, o1=100, o2=100\n    o2=temp; //temp=50, o1=100, o2=50\n} //method terminated\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice that we are changing values of o1 and o2 but they are copies of “red” and “blue” reference locations, so actually, there is no change in the values of “red” and “blue” and hence the output.</p>\n\n<p>If you have understood this far, you can easily understand the cause of confusion. Since the variables are just the reference to the objects, we get confused that we are passing the reference so Java is passed by reference. However, we are passing a copy of the reference and hence it’s pass by value. I hope it clears all the doubts now.</p>\n\n<p>Now let’s analyze <strong>foo()</strong> method execution.</p>\n\n<pre><code>private static void foo(Balloon balloon) { //baloon=100\n    balloon.setColor(\"Red\"); //baloon=100\n    balloon = new Balloon(\"Green\"); //baloon=200\n    balloon.setColor(\"Blue\"); //baloon = 200\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first line is the important one when we call a method the method is called on the Object at the reference location.

Java makes data communications from one function to other function only in a pass by value environment.</p>\n\n<p>An important point would be to know that even C language is strictly passed by value only:<br>\n<em>ie:</em> Data is copied from caller to the callee and more ever the operation performed by the callee are on the same memory location and \nwhat we pass them is the address of that location that we obtain from (&amp;) operator and the identifier used in the formal parameters are declared to be a pointer variable (*) using which we can get inside the memory location for accessing the data in it.</p>\n\n<p>Hence here the formal parameter is nothing but mere aliases for that location. And any modifications done on that location is visible where ever that scope of the variable (that identifies that location) is alive.</p>\n\n<p>In Java, there is no concept of pointers (<em>ie:</em> there is nothing called a pointer variable), although we can think of reference variable as a pointer technically in java we call it as a handle. The reason why we call the pointer to an address as a handle in java is  because a pointer variable is capable of performing not just single dereferencing but multiple dereferencing \nfor example: <code>int *p;</code> in P means p points to an integer\nand <code>int **p;</code> in C means p is pointer to a pointer to an integer\nwe dont have this facility in Java, so its absolutely correct and technically legitimate to say it as an handle, also there are rules for pointer arithmetic in C. Which allows performing arithmetic operation on pointers with constraints on it. </p>\n\n<p>In C we call such mechanism of passing address and receiving them with pointer variables as <em>pass by reference</em> since we are passing their addresses and receiving them as pointer variable in formal parameter but at the compiler level that address is copied into pointer variable (since data here is address even then its data ) hence we can be 100% sure that C is Strictly passed by value (as we are passing data only)</p>\n\n<p>(and if we pass the data directly in C we call that as pass by value.)</p>\n\n<p>In java when we do the same we do it with the handles; since they are not called pointer variables like in (as discussed above) even though we are passing the references we cannot say its pass by reference since we are not collecting that with a pointer variable in Java.</p>\n\n<p>Hence Java <strong>strictly use pass by value mechanism</strong> </p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":54199,"user_id":1697099,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gerXo.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Premraj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1697099/premraj"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1513419550,"score":10,"last_activity_date":1513419912,"last_edit_date":1513419912,"creation_date":1513419550,"answer_id":47844599,"question_id":40480,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<ul>\n<li><p><strong>passed by reference :</strong> caller and callee use same variable for parameter.  </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>passed by value :</strong> caller and callee have two independent variables with same value.  </p></li>\n<li>Java uses pass by value \n\n<ul>\n<li>When passing primitive data, it copies the value of primitive data type.</li>\n<li>When passing object, it copies the address of object and passes to callee method variable.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Example using primitive data type: </p>\n\n<pre><code>public class PassByValuePrimitive {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int i=5;\n        System.out.println(i);  //prints 5\n        change(i);\n        System.out.println(i);  //prints 5\n    }\n\n\n    private static void change(int i) {\n        System.out.println(i);  //prints 5\n        i=10;\n        System.out.println(i); //prints 10\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Example using object:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class PassByValueObject {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n        list.add(\"prem\");\n        list.add(\"raj\");\n        new PassByValueObject().change(list);\n        System.out.println(list); // prints [prem, raj, ram]\n\n    }\n\n\n    private  void change(List list) {\n        System.out.println(list.get(0)); // prem\n        list.add(\"ram\");\n        list=null;\n        System.out.println(list.add(\"bheem\")); //gets NullPointerException\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":2051,"user_id":1977836,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/34HNM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Felypp Oliveira","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1977836/felypp-oliveira"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1517606636,"score":23,"last_activity_date":1544209359,"last_edit_date":1544209359,"creation_date":1517606636,"answer_id":48591063,"question_id":40480,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"<p>This is the best way to answer the question imo...</p>\n\n<p>First, we must understand that, in Java, the <em>parameter passing behavior</em>...</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void foo(Object param)\n{\n  // some code in foo...\n}\n\npublic void bar()\n{\n  Object obj = new Object();\n\n  foo(obj);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is exactly the same as...</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void bar()\n{\n  Object obj = new Object();\n\n  Object param = obj;\n\n  // some code in foo...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>not considering stack locations, which aren't relevant in this discussion.</p>\n\n<p>So, in fact, what we're looking for in Java is how <em>variable assignment</em> works.

He also keeps a tally of how many people have asked about the listing.\nBob's integer <code>viewTally</code> for the house is at 42 today.</p>\n<p>Whenever someone wants info about the blue Tiny House at 1234 Main St, they ask Bob.</p>\n<p>Bob looks up his Listing <code>tinyHouseAt1234Main</code> and tells them all about it - the color, the nice lawn, the loft bed and the composting toilet, etc. Then he adds their inquiry to his <code>viewTally</code>. He doesn't tell them the real, physical address though, because Bob's firm specializes in Tiny Houses that could be moved at any time. The tally is now 43.</p>\n<p>At another firm, Realtors might explicitly say their listing &quot;points&quot; to the house at 1234 Main St, denoting this with a little <code>*</code> next to it, because they mainly deal with houses that rarely ever move (though presumably there are reasons for doing so). Bob's firm doesn't bother doing this.</p>\n<p>Now, of course Bob doesn't physically go and put the <em>actual</em> house on a truck to show it to clients directly - that would be impractical and a ridiculous waste of resources. Passing a full copy of his tally sheet is one thing, but passing around the whole house all the time is costly and ridiculous.</p>\n<p>(Aside: Bob's firm also doesn't 3D print new &amp; unique copies of a listed house every single time someone asks about it. That's what the upstart, similarly named web-based firm &amp; its spinoffs do - that's expensive and slower, and people often get the 2 firms confused, but they're quite popular anyway).</p>\n<p>At some other, older firms closer to the Sea, a realtor like Bob might not even exist to manage the Listings. Clients might instead consult the Rolodex &quot;Annie&quot; (<code>&amp;</code> for short) for the direct address of the house. Instead of reading off the referenced house details from the listing like Bob does, clients instead get the house address from Annie (<code>&amp;</code>), and go directly to 1234 Main St, sometimes w/no idea what they might find there.</p>\n<p>One day, Bob's firm begins offering a new automated service that needs the listing for a house the client is interested in.</p>\n<p>Well, the person with that info is Bob, so the client has Bob call up the service and send it a copy of the listing.</p>\n<p><code>jobKillingAutomatedListingService(Listing tinyHouseAt1234Main, int viewTally)</code> Bob sends along ...</p>\n<p>The service, on its end, calls this Listing <code>houseToLookAt</code>, but really what it receives is an exact copy of Bob's listing, with the exact same VALUEs in it, that refer to the house at 1234 Main St.</p>\n<p>This new service also has its own internal tally of how many people have viewed the listing. The service accepts Bob's tally out of professional courtesy, but it doesn't really care and overwrites it entirely with its own local copy anyway. It's tally for today is 1, while Bob's is still 43.</p>\n<p>The realty firms call this &quot;pass-by-value&quot; since Bob's passing the current value of his <code>viewTally</code> and his Listing <code>tinyHouseAt1234Main</code>. He's not actually passing along the entire physical house, because that's impractical. Nor is he passing the real physical address like Annie(<code>&amp;</code>) would do.</p>\n<p>But he IS passing a copy of <em>the value OF</em> the reference he has to the house. Seems like a silly pedantic difference in some ways, but that's how his firm works ...\n..............</p>\n<h2>PT II: Where things get confusing and dangerous ...</h2>\n<p>The new automated service, not being all functional and math-oriented like some other trendy financial &amp; scientific firms, can have unforeseen side effects...</p>\n<p>Once given a Listing object it allows clients to <em>actually</em> repaint the REAL house at 1234 Main St, using a remote drone robot fleet! It allows clients to control a robot bulldozer to ACTUALLY dig up the flower bed! This is madness!!!</p>\n<p>The service also lets clients completely redirect <code>houseToLookAt</code> to some other house at another address, without involving Bob or his listing. All of a sudden they could be looking at 4321 Elm St. instead, which has no connection whatsoever to Bob's listing (thankfully they can't do anymore damage).</p>\n<p>Bob watches all this on his realtime webcam.\nResigned to the drudgery of his sole job responsibility, he tells clients about the new ugly paint job &amp; sudden lack of curb appeal. His Listing <em>is</em> still for 1234 Main St., after all. The new service's <code>houseToLookAt</code> couldn't change that. Bob reports the details of his <code>tinyHouseAt1234Main</code> accurately and dutifully as always, until he gets fired or the house is destroyed entirely by The Nothing.</p>\n<p>Really the only thing the service CAN'T do with its <code>houseToLookAt</code> copy of the Bob's original listing is change the address from 1234 Main St. to some other address, or to a void of nothingness, or to some random type of object like a Platypus. Bob's Listing still always points to 1234 Main St, for whatever it's still worth. He passes its current value around like always.</p>\n<p>This bizarre side-effect of passing a listing to the new automated service is confusing for people who ask about how it works. Really, what's the difference between the ability to remotely control robots that alter the state of the house at 1234 Main, vs. <em>actually</em> physically going there and wreaking havoc because Annie gave you the address??</p>\n<p>Seems like kind of a nitpicky semantic argument if what you generally care about is the <em>state</em> of the house in the listing being copied and passed around, right?</p>\n<p>I mean, if you were in the business of actually picking up houses and physically moving them to other addresses (not like mobile or Tiny Homes where that's sort of an expected function of the platform), or you were accessing, renaming, and shuffling entire neighborhoods like some sort of low-level God-playing madman, THEN maybe you'd care more about passing around those specific address references instead of just copies of the the latest value of the house details ...</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":467,"user_id":4109266,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fA4Tx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4109266/michael"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1522799290,"score":35,"last_activity_date":1588450710,"last_edit_date":1588450710,"creation_date":1522799290,"answer_id":49640653,"question_id":40480,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"<p>Unlike some other languages, Java does not allow you to choose between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference—all arguments are passed by value. A method call can pass two types of values to a method—copies of primitive values (e.g., values of int and double) and copies of references to objects.</p>\n\n<p>When a method modifies a primitive-type parameter, changes to the parameter have no effect on the original argument value in the calling method.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to objects, objects themselves cannot be passed to methods. So we pass the reference(address) of the object. We can manipulate the original object using this reference.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How Java creates and stores objects:</strong> When we create an object we store the object’s address in a reference variable. Let's analyze the following statement.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Account account1 = new Account();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>“Account account1” is the type and name of the reference variable, “=” is the assignment operator, “new” asks for the required amount of space from the system. The constructor to the right of keyword new which creates the object is called implicitly by the keyword new. Address of the created object(result of right value, which is an expression called \"class instance creation expression\") is assigned to the left value (which is a reference variable with a name and a type specified) using the assign operator.</p>\n\n<p>Although an object’s reference is passed by value, a method can still interact with the referenced object by calling its public methods using the copy of the object’s reference. Since the reference stored in the parameter is a copy of the reference that was passed as an argument, the parameter in the called method and the argument in the calling method refer to the same object in memory.</p>\n\n<p>Passing references to arrays, instead of the array objects themselves, makes sense for performance reasons. Because everything in Java is passed by value, if array objects were passed,\na copy of each element would be passed. For large arrays, this would waste time and consume\nconsiderable storage for the copies of the elements.</p>\n\n<p>In the image below you can see we have two reference variables(These are called pointers in C/C++, and I think that term makes it easier to understand this feature.) in the main method. Primitive and reference variables are kept in stack memory(left side in images below). array1 and array2 reference variables \"point\" (as C/C++ programmers call it) or reference to a and b arrays respectively, which are objects (values these reference variables hold are addresses of objects) in heap memory (right side in images below).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sF7QZ.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sF7QZ.png\" alt=\"Pass by value example 1\"></a></p>\n\n<p>If we pass the value of array1 reference variable as an argument to the reverseArray method, a reference variable is created in the method and that reference variable starts pointing to the same array (a). </p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Test\n{\n    public static void reverseArray(int[] array1)\n    {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args)\n    {\n        int[] array1 = { 1, 10, -7 };\n        int[] array2 = { 5, -190, 0 };\n\n        reverseArray(array1);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/W1wgZ.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/W1wgZ.png\" alt=\"Pass by value example 2\"></a></p>\n\n<p>So, if we say </p>\n\n<pre><code>array1[0] = 5;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>in reverseArray method, it will make a change in array a.</p>\n\n<p>We have another reference variable in reverseArray method (array2) that points to an array c.

I wanted to make a small contribution by sharing a <strong>very simple example</strong> (which will compile) contrasting the behaviors between Pass-by-reference in c++ and Pass-by-value in Java.</p>\n\n<p>A few points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The term \"reference\" is a overloaded with two separate meanings. In Java it simply means a pointer, but in the context of \"Pass-by-reference\" it means a handle to the original variable which was passed in.</li>\n<li><strong>Java is Pass-by-value</strong>. Java is a descendent of C (among other languages). Before C, several (but not all) earlier languages like FORTRAN and COBOL supported PBR, but C did not. PBR allowed these other languages to make changes to the passed variables inside sub-routines. In order to accomplish the same thing (i.e. change the values of variables inside functions), C programmers passed pointers to variables into functions. Languages inspired by C, such as Java, borrowed this idea and continue to pass pointer to methods as C did, except that Java calls its pointers References. Again, this is a different use of the word \"Reference\" than in \"Pass-By-Reference\".</li>\n<li><strong>C++ allows Pass-by-reference</strong> by declaring a reference parameter using the \"&amp;\" character (which happens to be the same character used to indicate \"the address of a variable\" in both C and C++). For example, if we pass in a pointer by reference, the parameter and the argument are not just pointing to the same object. Rather, they are the same variable. If one gets set to a different address or to null, so does the other.</li>\n<li>In the C++ example below I'm passing a <strong>pointer</strong> to a null terminated string <strong>by reference</strong>. And in the Java example below I'm passing a Java reference to a String (again, the same as a pointer to a String) by value. Notice the output in the comments.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>C++ pass by reference example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>using namespace std;\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\nvoid change (char *&amp;str){   // the '&amp;' makes this a reference parameter\n    str = NULL;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    char *str = \"not Null\";\n    change(str);\n    cout&lt;&lt;\"str is \" &lt;&lt; str;      // ==&gt;str is &lt;null&gt;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Java pass \"a Java reference\" by value example</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ValueDemo{\n\n    public void change (String str){\n        str = null;\n    }\n\n     public static void main(String []args){\n        ValueDemo vd = new ValueDemo();\n        String str = \"not null\";\n        vd.change(str);\n        System.out.println(\"str is \" + str);    // ==&gt; str is not null!!\n                                                // Note that if \"str\" was\n                                                // passed-by-reference, it\n                                                // WOULD BE NULL after the\n                                                // call to change().\n     }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>Several people have written comments which seem to indicate that either they are not looking at my examples or they don't get the c++ example. Not sure where the disconnect is, but guessing the c++ example is not clear. I'm posting the same example in pascal because I think pass-by-reference looks cleaner in pascal, but I could be wrong. I might just be confusing people more; I hope not.</p>\n\n<p>In pascal, parameters passed-by-reference are called \"var parameters\". In the procedure setToNil below, please note the keyword 'var' which precedes the parameter 'ptr'. When a pointer is passed to this procedure, it will be passed <strong>by reference</strong>. Note the behavior: when this procedure sets ptr to nil (that's pascal speak for NULL), it will set the argument to nil--you can't do that in Java.</p>\n\n<pre><code>program passByRefDemo;\ntype \n   iptr = ^integer;\nvar\n   ptr: iptr;\n\n   procedure setToNil(var ptr : iptr);\n   begin\n       ptr := nil;\n   end;\n\nbegin\n   new(ptr);\n   ptr^ := 10;\n   setToNil(ptr);\n   if (ptr = nil) then\n       writeln('ptr seems to be nil');     { ptr should be nil, so this line will run. }\nend.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some excerpts from <strong>\"THE Java Programming Language\"</strong> by Ken Arnold, <strong>James Gosling (the guy who invented Java)</strong>, and David Holmes, chapter 2, section 2.6.5</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>All parameters to methods are passed \"by value\"</strong>. In other words,\n  values of parameter variables in a method are copies of the invoker\n  specified as arguments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He goes on to make the same point regarding objects . . . </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You should note that when the parameter is an object reference, it is\n  the object reference-not the object itself-that is <strong>passed \"by value\"</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And towards the end of the same section he makes a broader statement about java being only pass by value and never pass by reference.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Java programming language <strong>does not pass objects by reference; it</strong>\n  <strong>passes object references by value</strong>. Because two copies of the same\n  reference refer to the same actual object, changes made through one\n  reference variable are visible through the other. There is exactly one\n  parameter passing mode-<strong>pass by value</strong>-and that helps keep things\n  simple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This section of the book has a great explanation of parameter passing in Java and of the distinction between pass-by-reference and pass-by-value and it's by the creator of Java. I would encourage anyone to read it, especially if you're still not convinced.</p>\n\n<p>I think the difference between the two models is very subtle and unless you've done programming where you actually used pass-by-reference, it's easy to miss where two models differ.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this settles the debate, but probably won't.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong></p>\n\n<p>I might be a little obsessed with this post. Probably because I feel that the makers of Java inadvertently spread misinformation. If instead of using the word \"reference\" for pointers they had used something else, say \ndingleberry, there would've been no problem. You could say, \"Java passes dingleberries by value and not by reference\", and nobody would be confused.</p>\n\n<p>That's the reason only Java developers have issue with this. They look at the word \"reference\" and think they know exactly what that means, so they don't even bother to consider the opposing argument.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I noticed a comment in an older post, which made a balloon analogy which I really liked. So much so that I decided to glue together some clip-art to make a set of cartoons to illustrate the point.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Passing a reference by value</strong>--Changes to the reference are not reflected in the caller's scope, but the changes to the object are. This is because the reference is copied, but the both the original and the copy refer to the same object.\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RvkqU.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RvkqU.png\" alt=\"Passing Object references By Value\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Pass by reference</strong>--There is no copy of the reference. Single reference is shared by both the caller and the function being called. Any changes to the reference or the Object's data are reflected in the caller's scope.\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SHXkC.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SHXkC.png\" alt=\"Pass by reference\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 4</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have seen posts on this topic which describe the low level implementation of parameter passing in Java, which I think is great and very helpful because it makes an abstract idea concrete. However, to me the question is more about <strong>the behavior described in the language specification</strong> than about the technical implementation of the behavior. This is an exerpt from the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Java Language Specification, section 8.4.1</a> :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When the method or constructor is invoked (§15.12), <strong>the values of the\n  actual argument expressions initialize newly created parameter\n  variables, each of the declared type, before execution of the body of\n  the method or constructor.</strong> The Identifier that appears in the\n  DeclaratorId may be used as a simple name in the body of the method or\n  constructor to refer to the formal parameter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which means, java creates a copy of the passed parameters before executing a method. Like most people who studied compilers in college, I used <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201100886\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"The Dragon Book\"</a> which is <strong>THE</strong> compilers book. It has a good description of \"Call-by-value\" and \"Call-by-Reference\" in Chapter 1. The Call-by-value description matches up with Java Specs exactly.</p>\n\n<p>Back when I studied compilers-in the 90's, I used the first edition of the book from 1986 which pre-dated Java by about 9 or 10 years. However, I just ran across a copy of the <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B009TGD06W\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2nd Eddition</a> from 2007 <strong>which actually mentions Java!</strong> Section 1.6.6 labeled \"Parameter Passing Mechanisms\" describes parameter passing pretty nicely. Here is an excerpt under the heading \"Call-by-value\" which mentions Java:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In call-by-value, the actual parameter is evaluated (if it is an\n  expression) or copied (if it is a variable). The value is placed in\n  the location belonging to the corresponding formal parameter of the\n  called procedure. <strong>This method is used in C and Java, and is a common\n  option in C++ , as well as in most other languages.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":2566,"user_id":959876,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7fYC4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"moldovean","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/959876/moldovean"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1556635845,"score":12,"last_activity_date":1556635845,"creation_date":1556635845,"answer_id":55923549,"question_id":40480,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"<p>Long story short: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Non-primitives: Java passes the <em>Value of the Reference</em>.  </li>\n<li>Primitives: just value. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The End.</p>\n\n<p>(2) is too easy.

The stack memory is pre-allocated to thread, when it is created, therefore, a thread cannot access the Stack of other thread. But Heap is available to all threads in a program.</p>\n\n<p>For a thread, Stack stores all local data, metadata of program, primitive type data and object reference. And, Heap is responsible for storage of actual object.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Book book = new Book(\"Effective Java\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above example, the reference variable is \"book\" which is stored in stack. The instance created by new operator -> new Book(\"Effective Java\") is stored in Heap. The ref variable \"book\" has address of the object allocated in Heap. Let's say the address is 1001.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uw7tE.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uw7tE.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Consider passing a primitive data type i.e. int, float, double etc.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class PrimitiveTypeExample { \n    public static void main(string[] args) {\n       int num = 10;\n       System.out.println(\"Value before calling method: \" + num);\n       printNum(num);\n       System.out.println(\"Value after calling method: \" + num);\n    }\n    public static void printNum(int num){\n       num = num + 10;\n       System.out.println(\"Value inside printNum method: \" + num);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Output is:\nValue before calling method: 10\nValue inside printNum method: 20\nValue after calling method: 10</p>\n\n<p>int num =10; -> this allocates the memory for \"int\" in Stack of the running thread, because, it is a primitive type.  Now when printNum(..) is called, a private stack is created within the same thread. When \"num\" is passed to this method, a copy of \"num\" is created in the method stack frame.\nnum = num+10; -> this adds 10 and modifies the the int variable within the method stack frame.\nTherefore, the original num outside the method stack frame remains unchanged.</p>\n\n<p>Consider, the example of passing the object of a custom class as an argument.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/J1XRW.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/J1XRW.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In the above example, ref variable \"book\" resides in stack of thread executing the program, and the object of class Book is created in Heap space when program executes new Book(). This memory location in Heap is referred by \"book\". When \"book\" is passed as method argument, a copy  of \"book\" is created in  private stack frame of method within the same stack of thread. Therefore, the copied reference variable points to the same object of class \"Book\" in the Heap.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ggqd5.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ggqd5.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The reference variable within method stack frame sets a new value to same object. Therefore, it is reflected when original ref variable \"book\" gets its value.\nNote that in case of passing reference variable, if it is initialized again in called method, it then points to new memory location and any operation does not affect the previous object in the Heap.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when anything is passed as method argument, it is always the Stack entity - either primitive or reference variable. We never pass something that is stored in Heap. Hence, in Java, we always pass the value in the stack, and it is pass by value.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":59,"user_id":11725130,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b514002eb9fd47984b587804983c3512?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Rose","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11725130/rose"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1569053347,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569053347,"creation_date":1569053347,"answer_id":58038425,"question_id":40480,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"<p>I think this simple explanation might help you understand as I wanted to understand this same thing when I was struggling through this.</p>\n\n<p>When you pass a primitive data to a function call it's content is being copied to the function's argument and when you pass an object it's reference is being copied to the function's argument. Speaking of object, you can't change the copied reference-<em>the argument variable is referencing to</em> in the calling function.</p>\n\n<p>Consider this simple example, String is an object in java and when you change the content of a string the reference variable will now point to some new reference as String objects are immutable in java.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>String name=\"Mehrose\";  // name referencing to 100\n\nChangeContenet(String name){\n name=\"Michael\"; // refernce has changed to 1001\n\n} \nSystem.out.print(name);  //displays Mehrose\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Fairly simple because as I mentioned you are not allowed to change the copied reference in the calling function. But the problem is with the array when you pass an array of String/Object. Let us see.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>String names[]={\"Mehrose\",\"Michael\"};\n\nchangeContent(String[] names){\n  names[0]=\"Rose\";\n  names[1]=\"Janet\"\n\n}\n\nSystem.out.println(Arrays.toString(names)); //displays [Rose,Janet]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As we said that we can't change the copied reference in the function call and we also have seen in the case of a single String object. The reason is names[] variable referencing to let's say 200 and names[0] referencing to 205 and so on. You see we didn't change the names[] reference it still points to the old same reference still after the function call but now names[0] and names[1] reference has been changed. We Still stand on our definition that we can't change the reference variable's reference so we didn't.</p>\n\n<p>The same thing happens when you pass a Student object to a method and you are still able to change the Student name or other attributes, the point is we are not changing the actual Student object rather we are changing the contents of it</p>\n\n<p>You can't do this</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Student student1= new Student(\"Mehrose\");\n\nchangeContent(Student Obj){\n obj= new Student(\"Michael\") //invalid\n obj.setName(\"Michael\")  //valid\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":1592,"user_id":7888956,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vfzrr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DeC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7888956/dec"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1575281531,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1578034062,"last_edit_date":1578034062,"creation_date":1572924323,"answer_id":58704042,"question_id":40480,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"<p>A: Java does manipulate objects by reference, and all object variables are references. However, Java doesn't pass method arguments by reference; it passes them by value.</p>\n\n<p>Take the badSwap() method for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void badSwap(int var1, int var2)\n{\n  int temp = var1;\n  var1 = var2;\n  var2 = temp;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When badSwap() returns, the variables passed as arguments will still hold their original values. The method will also fail if we change the arguments type from int to Object, since Java passes object references by value as well. Now, here is where it gets tricky:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void tricky(Point arg1, Point arg2)\n{\n  arg1.x = 100;\n  arg1.y = 100;\n  Point temp = arg1;\n  arg1 = arg2;\n  arg2 = temp;\n}\npublic static void main(String [] args)\n{\n  Point pnt1 = new Point(0,0);\n  Point pnt2 = new Point(0,0);\n  System.out.println(\"X: \" + pnt1.x + \" Y: \" +pnt1.y); \n  System.out.println(\"X: \" + pnt2.x + \" Y: \" +pnt2.y);\n  System.out.println(\" \");\n  tricky(pnt1,pnt2);\n  System.out.println(\"X: \" + pnt1.x + \" Y:\" + pnt1.y); \n  System.out.println(\"X: \" + pnt2.x + \" Y: \" +pnt2.y);  \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If we execute this main() method, we see the following output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>X: 0 Y: 0\nX: 0 Y: 0\nX: 100 Y: 100\nX: 0 Y: 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The method successfully alters the value of pnt1, even though it is passed by value; however, a swap of pnt1 and pnt2 fails! This is the major source of confusion. In the main() method, pnt1 and pnt2 are nothing more than object references. When you pass pnt1 and pnt2 to the tricky() method, Java passes the references by value just like any other parameter. This means the references passed to the method are actually copies of the original references. Figure 1 below shows two references pointing to the same object after Java passes an object to a method.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wLEj7.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wLEj7.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a><br>\nFigure 1. After being passed to a method, an object will have at least two references</p>\n\n<p>Java copies and passes the reference by value, not the object. Thus, method manipulation will alter the objects, since the references point to the original objects. But since the references are copies, swaps will fail.The method references swap, but not the original references. Unfortunately, after a method call, you are left with only the unswapped original references. For a swap to succeed outside of the method call, we need to swap the original references, not the copies.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1191,"user_id":1028560,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0357781c153374f699360c669c31b4fa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sanjeev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1028560/sanjeev"},"edited":false,"score":4,"creation_date":1582237478,"post_id":60141523,"comment_id":106718686,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"Object references (i.e. pointers) are passed by value and primitives are also passed by value.

This is a copy of the contents of the actual parameter.</p>\n<p>Pass by reference (also called pass by address) means that a copy of the address of the actual parameter is stored.</p>\n<p>Sometimes Java can give the illusion of pass by reference. Let's see how it works by using the example below:</p>\n<pre><code>public class PassByValue {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Test t = new Test();\n        t.name = &quot;initialvalue&quot;;\n        new PassByValue().changeValue(t);\n        System.out.println(t.name);\n    }\n    \n    public void changeValue(Test f) {\n        f.name = &quot;changevalue&quot;;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Test {\n    String name;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The output of this program is:</p>\n<p>changevalue\nLet's understand step by step:</p>\n<p>Test t = new Test();\nAs we all know it will create an object in the heap and return the reference value back to t. For example, suppose the value of t is 0x100234 (we don't know the actual JVM internal value, this is just an example) .</p>\n<p>first illustration</p>\n<pre><code>new PassByValue().changeValue(t);\n</code></pre>\n<p>When passing reference t to the function it will not directly pass the actual reference value of object test, but it will create a copy of t and then pass it to the function. Since it is passing by value, it passes a copy of the variable rather than the actual reference of it. Since we said the value of t was 0x100234, both t and f will have the same value and hence they will point to the same object.</p>\n<p>second illustration</p>\n<p>If you change anything in the function using reference f it will modify the existing contents of the object. That is why we got the output changevalue, which is updated in the function.</p>\n<p>To understand this more clearly, consider the following example:</p>\n<pre><code>public class PassByValue {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Test t = new Test();\n        t.name = &quot;initialvalue&quot;;\n        new PassByValue().changeRefence(t);\n        System.out.println(t.name);\n    }\n    \n    public void changeRefence(Test f) {\n        f = null;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Test {\n    String name;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Will this throw a NullPointerException? No, because it only passes a copy of the reference. In the case of passing by reference, it could have thrown a NullPointerException, as seen below:</p>\n<p>third illustration</p>\n<p>Hopefully this will help.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":805,"user_id":8932910,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b8ed75b474f7bc5dcf6dfb8c778d17a2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8932910/jack"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1609015769,"score":8,"last_activity_date":1609016307,"last_edit_date":1609016307,"creation_date":1609015769,"answer_id":65460603,"question_id":40480,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"<p>Not to repeat, but one point to those who might still be confused after reading many answers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pass by value</code> in Java is <strong>NOT EQUAL</strong> to <code>pass by value</code> in C++, though it sounds like that, which is probably why there's confusion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Breaking it down:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pass by value</code> in C++ means passing the value of the object (if object), literarily the copy of the object</li>\n<li><code>pass by value</code> in Java means passing the address value of the object (if object), not really the &quot;value&quot; (a copy) of the object like C++</li>\n<li>By <code>pass by value</code> in Java, operating on an object (e.g. <code>myObj.setName(&quot;new&quot;)</code>) inside a function <strong>has effects</strong> on the object outside the function; by <code>pass by value</code> in C++, it has <strong>NO</strong> effects on the one outside.</li>\n<li>However, by <code>pass by reference</code> in C++, operating on an object in a function <strong>DOES</strong> have effects on the one outside!

Additionally, when writing their own code, they tend to rely on returning nulls to indicate something thus requiring the caller to check for nulls.</p>\n\n<p>To put this another way, there are two instances where null checking comes up:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Where null is a valid response in terms of the contract; and</p></li>\n<li><p>Where it isn't a valid response.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(2) is easy.  Either use <code>assert</code> statements (assertions) or allow failure (for example,  <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/index.html?java/lang/NullPointerException.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">NullPointerException</a>).  Assertions are a highly-underused Java feature that was added in 1.4.  The syntax is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>assert &lt;condition&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<pre><code>assert &lt;condition&gt; : &lt;object&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where <code>&lt;condition&gt;</code> is a boolean expression and <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> is an object whose <code>toString()</code> method's output will be included in the error.</p>\n\n<p>An <code>assert</code> statement throws an <code>Error</code> (<code>AssertionError</code>) if the condition is not true.  By default, Java ignores assertions.  You can enable assertions by passing the option <code>-ea</code> to the JVM.  You can enable and disable assertions for individual classes and packages.  This means that you can validate code with the assertions while developing and testing, and disable them in a production environment, although my testing has shown next to no performance impact from assertions.</p>\n\n<p>Not using assertions in this case is OK because the code will just fail, which is what will happen if you use assertions.  The only difference is that with assertions it might happen sooner, in a more-meaningful way and possibly with extra information, which may help you to figure out why it happened if you weren't expecting it.</p>\n\n<p>(1) is a little harder.  If you have no control over the code you're calling then you're stuck.  If null is a valid response, you have to check for it.</p>\n\n<p>If it's code that you do control, however (and this is often the case), then it's a different story.  Avoid using nulls as a response.  With methods that return collections, it's easy: return empty collections (or arrays) instead of nulls pretty much all the time.</p>\n\n<p>With non-collections it might be harder.  Consider this as an example: if you have these interfaces:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface Action {\n  void doSomething();\n}\n\npublic interface Parser {\n  Action findAction(String userInput);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where Parser takes raw user input and finds something to do, perhaps if you're implementing a command line interface for something.  Now you might make the contract that it returns null if there's no appropriate action.  That leads the null checking you're talking about.</p>\n\n<p>An alternative solution is to never return null and instead use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Null Object pattern</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyParser implements Parser {\n  private static Action DO_NOTHING = new Action() {\n    public void doSomething() { /* do nothing */ }\n  };\n\n  public Action findAction(String userInput) {\n    // ...\n    if ( /* we can't find any actions */ ) {\n      return DO_NOTHING;\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Compare:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Parser parser = ParserFactory.getParser();\nif (parser == null) {\n  // now what?\n  // this would be an example of where null isn't (or shouldn't be) a valid response\n}\nAction action = parser.findAction(someInput);\nif (action == null) {\n  // do nothing\n} else {\n  action.doSomething();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to</p>\n\n<pre><code>ParserFactory.getParser().findAction(someInput).doSomething();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which is a much better design because it leads to more concise code.</p>\n\n<p>That said, perhaps it is entirely appropriate for the findAction() method to throw an Exception with a meaningful error message -- especially in this case where you are relying on user input.  It would be much better for the findAction method to throw an Exception than for the calling method to blow up with a simple NullPointerException with no explanation.</p>\n\n<pre><code>try {\n    ParserFactory.getParser().findAction(someInput).doSomething();\n} catch(ActionNotFoundException anfe) {\n    userConsole.err(anfe.getMessage());\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or if you think the try/catch mechanism is too ugly, rather than Do Nothing your default action should provide feedback to the user.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public Action findAction(final String userInput) {\n    /* Code to return requested Action if found */\n    return new Action() {\n        public void doSomething() {\n            userConsole.err(\"Action not found: \" + userInput);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3245,"user_id":181551,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":41,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5bdec1e17ffb5c23f339bf527434a067?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alex Worden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/181551/alex-worden"},"edited":false,"score":42,"creation_date":1306174456,"post_id":275869,"comment_id":7073436,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"I agree - only in that situation.

If you're not exiting the method with some sort of error then it means nothing went wrong in your method which is not true. Then you probably return null in this case, and in the receiving method you again check for null, and it never ends, and you end up with \"if != null\", etc..</p>\n\n<p>So, IMHO, null must be a critical error which prevents further execution (that is, where null is not a valid value).</p>\n\n<p>The way I solve this problem is this:</p>\n\n<p>First, I follow this convention:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>All public methods / API always check its arguments for null</li>\n<li>All private methods do not check for null since they are controlled methods (just let die with nullpointer exception in case it wasn't handled above)</li>\n<li>The only other methods which do not check for null are utility methods. They are public, but if you call them for some reason, you know what parameters you pass. This is like trying to boil water in the kettle without providing water...</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And finally, in the code, the first line of the public method goes like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ValidationUtils.getNullValidator().addParam(plans, \"plans\").addParam(persons, \"persons\").validate();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that addParam() returns self, so that you can add more parameters to check.</p>\n\n<p>Method <code>validate()</code> will throw checked <code>ValidationException</code> if any of the parameters is null (checked or unchecked is more a design/taste issue, but my <code>ValidationException</code> is checked).</p>\n\n<pre><code>void validate() throws ValidationException;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The message will contain the following text if, for example, \"plans\" is null:</p>\n\n<p>\"<strong>Illegal argument value null is encountered for parameter [plans]</strong>\"</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, the second value in the addParam() method (string) is needed for the user message, because you cannot easily detect passed-in variable name, even with reflection (not subject of this post anyway...).</p>\n\n<p>And yes, we know that beyond this line we will no longer encounter a null value so we just safely invoke methods on those objects.</p>\n\n<p>This way, the code is clean, easy maintainable and readable.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1634,"user_id":1342121,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/77514447b0277a930a8f46776a3da885?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ianpojman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1342121/ianpojman"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1350531331,"post_id":6101200,"comment_id":17549406,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"better to use assertions, i.e Contract.notNull(abc, &quot;abc must be non-null, did it fail to load during xyz?&quot;); - this is a more compact way than doing an if (abc!=null) { throw new RuntimeException...}"}],"owner":{"reputation":3245,"user_id":181551,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":41,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5bdec1e17ffb5c23f339bf527434a067?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alex Worden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/181551/alex-worden"},"comment_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1319187757,"score":93,"last_activity_date":1335208149,"last_edit_date":1335208149,"creation_date":1306174694,"answer_id":6101200,"question_id":271526,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>I'm a fan of \"fail fast\" code.

To use the first most advantage of exceptions and separate error-handling code from 'regular' code (<a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/advantages.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">according to creators of Java</a>) it is appropriate, as for me, to catch <code>NullPointerException</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public Photo getGirlfriendPhoto() {\n    try {\n        return appContext.getPhotoDataSource().getPhotoByName(me.getGirlfriend().getName());\n    } catch (NullPointerException e) {\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Questions could arise:</p>\n\n<p>Q. What if <code>getPhotoDataSource()</code> returns null?<br>\nA. It is up to business logic. If I fail to find a photo album I'll show you no photos. What if appContext is not initialized? This method's business logic puts up with this. If the same logic should be more strict then throwing an exception it is part of the business logic and explicit check for null should be used (case 3). The <strong>new Java Null-safe API fits better here to specify selectively what implies and what does not imply to be initialized</strong> to be fail-fast in case of programmer errors.</p>\n\n<p>Q. Redundant code could be executed and unnecessary resources could be grabbed.<br>\nA. It could take place if <code>getPhotoByName()</code> would try to open a database connection, create <code>PreparedStatement</code> and use the person name as an SQL parameter at last. The approach <em>for an unknown question gives an unknown answer</em> (case 1) works here. Before grabbing resources the method should check parameters and return 'unknown' result if needed.</p>\n\n<p>Q. This approach has a performance penalty due to the try closure opening.<br>\nA. Software should be easy to understand and modify firstly. Only after this, one could think about performance, and only if needed! and where needed! (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/ref=dp_ob_title_bk\" rel=\"noreferrer\">source</a>), and many others).</p>\n\n<p>PS. This approach will be as reasonable to use as the <em>separate error-handling code from \"regular\" code</em> principle is reasonable to use in some place.

The most important thing for being able to reason about the behaviour of a piece of code is that it is written in a matter that is easy to understand. Name your variables based on what they represent, name your methods after what they do, apply the <code>Single responsibility principle</code> (the <code>S</code> in <code>SOLID</code>: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)</a>, it means that each piece of code should have a single responsibility, and do this and nothing else). Once your code is clean, it is much easier to reason about it, also across multiple tiers/layers of code. With messy code, trying to understand what a method does might make you forget why you are reading the method in the first place. (Tip: Read \"Clean Code\" by Robert C. Martin)</p></li>\n<li><p>Avoid returning <code>null</code> values. If a <code>null</code> value would keep your program from functioning correctly, throw an <code>exception</code> instead (make sure to add the appropriate error-handling.) Cases where returning a <code>null</code> value might be acceptable is for instance trying to fetch an object from the database. In these cases, write code that handles the <code>null</code> values, and make a note behind your ear that here we have something that might return <code>null</code>. Handle returned <code>null</code> values as close to the caller of the method returning <code>null</code> as possible (don't just blindly pass it back up the call-chain.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Never EVER pass explicit <code>null</code> values as parameters (at least not across classes). If you are ever in a position where passing a <code>null</code>-parameter is the only option, creating a new method that does not have this parameter is the way to go. </p></li>\n<li><p>Validate your input! Identify the \"entry-points\" to your application. They can everything from webservices, REST-services, remote EJB classes, controllers, etc. For each method in these entry-points, ask yourself: \"Will this method execute correctly if this parameter is null?\" If the answer is no, add <code>Validate.notNull(someParam, \"Can't function when someParam is null!\");</code>. This will throw an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> if the required parameter is missing. The good thing about this type of validation in the entry-points, is that you can then easily assume in the code being executed from the entry-point, that this variable will never be null! Also, if this fails, being at the entry-point, debugging is made a lot easier than it would if you just got a <code>NullPointerException</code> deep down in your code, since a failure like this can only mean one thing: The client didn't send you all the required information. In most cases you want to validate all input parameters, if you find yourself in a position where you need to allow a lot of <code>null</code>-values, it might be a sign of a badly designed interface, which needs refactoring/additions to suite the needs of the clients.</p></li>\n<li><p>When working with <code>Collection</code>s, return an empty one rather than null! </p></li>\n<li><p>When working with a database, utilize <code>not null</code>-constraints. In that way, you'll know that a value read from the database cannot be null, and you won't have to check for it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Structure your code and stick with it. Doing this allows you to make assumptions about the behaviour of the code, for instance if all input to your application is validated, then you can assume that these values will never be null. </p></li>\n<li><p>If you are not already doing it, write automated tests of your code. By writing tests, you will reason about your code, and you will also become more confident that it does what it's supposed to. Also, automated tests guards you from blunders during refactoring, by letting you know immediatly that this piece of code is not doing what it used to.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You still have to null-check of course, but it can trimmed down to the bare minimum (i.e. the situation where <em>know</em> you might be getting a null-value, instead of everywhere just to be sure.) When it comes to null-checks, i actually prefer to use the ternary operator (but use with care, when you start nesting them they come really messy.)</p>\n\n<pre><code>public String nullSafeToString(final Object o) {\n    return o != null ? o.toString() : \"null\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1236,"user_id":2100584,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/236ecbd2033b1620c2ae79a0877e1bba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tomas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2100584/tomas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1446177745,"post_id":21726959,"comment_id":54645620,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<code>javax</code> is, by definition, <i>not</i> &quot;core Java&quot;."}],"owner":{"reputation":32609,"user_id":2648077,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd10f51a1b9acf80448616c0a03cd261?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alireza Fattahi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2648077/alireza-fattahi"},"comment_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1392205296,"score":17,"last_activity_date":1398350885,"last_edit_date":1398350885,"creation_date":1392205296,"answer_id":21726959,"question_id":271526,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>May I answer it more generally!</p>\n\n<p>We <strong>usually</strong> face this issue when the methods get the parameters in the way we not expected (bad method call is programmer's fault).

You expect to get an String with at least one character, instead you get an empty String ...</p>\n\n<p>So there is no difference between:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if(object == null){\n   //you called my method badly!\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}</p>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<pre><code>if(str.length() == 0){\n   //you called my method badly again!\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>They both want to make sure that we received valid parameters, before we do any other functions.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned in some other answers, to avoid above problems you can follow the <strong>Design by contract</strong> pattern.

So there is official support in Java&nbsp;8 to address these issues without cluttered code.</p>\n\n<p>Java 8 has introduced <code>java.util.Optional&lt;T&gt;</code>. It is a container that may or may not hold a non-null value. Java 8 has given a safer way to handle an object whose value may be null in some of the cases. It is inspired from the ideas of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Haskell</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_%28programming_language%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Scala</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, the Optional class includes methods to explicitly deal with the cases where a value is present or absent. However, the advantage compared to null references is that the Optional&lt;T> class forces you to think about the case when the value is not present. As a consequence, you can prevent unintended null pointer exceptions.</p>\n\n<p>In above example we have a home service factory that returns a handle to multiple appliances available in the home. But these services may or may not be available/functional; it means it may result in a NullPointerException. Instead of adding a null <code>if</code> condition before using any service, let's wrap it in to Optional&lt;Service>.</p>\n\n<p>WRAPPING TO OPTION&lt;T></p>\n\n<p>Let's consider a method to get a reference of a service from a factory. Instead of returning the service reference, wrap it with Optional. It lets the API user know that the returned service may or may not available/functional, use defensively</p>\n\n<pre><code>public Optional&lt;Service&gt; getRefrigertorControl() {\n      Service s = new  RefrigeratorService();\n       //...\n      return Optional.ofNullable(s);\n   }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you see <code>Optional.ofNullable()</code> provides an easy way to get the reference wrapped. There are another ways to get the reference of Optional, either <code>Optional.empty()</code> &amp; <code>Optional.of()</code>. One for returning an empty object instead of retuning null and the other to wrap a non-nullable object, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>SO HOW EXACTLY IT HELPS TO AVOID A NULL CHECK?</p>\n\n<p>Once you have wrapped a reference object, Optional provides many useful methods to invoke methods on a wrapped reference without NPE.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Optional ref = homeServices.getRefrigertorControl();\nref.ifPresent(HomeServices::switchItOn);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Optional.ifPresent invokes the given Consumer with a reference if it is a non-null value. Otherwise, it does nothing.</p>\n\n<pre><code>@FunctionalInterface\npublic interface Consumer&lt;T&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result. Unlike most other functional interfaces, Consumer is expected to operate via side-effects.\nIt is so clean and easy to understand. In the above code example, <code>HomeService.switchOn(Service)</code> gets invoked if the Optional holding reference is non-null.</p>\n\n<p>We use the ternary operator very often for checking null condition and return an alternative value or default value. Optional provides another way to handle the same condition without checking null. Optional.orElse(defaultObj) returns defaultObj if the Optional has a null value. Let's use this in our sample code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static Optional&lt;HomeServices&gt; get() {\n    service = Optional.of(service.orElse(new HomeServices()));\n    return service;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now HomeServices.get() does same thing, but in a better way. It checks whether the service is already initialized of not. If it is then return the same or create a new New service. Optional&lt;T>.orElse(T) helps to return a default value.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, here is our NPE as well as null check-free code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.util.Optional;\npublic class HomeServices {\n    private static final int NOW = 0;\n    private static Optional&lt;HomeServices&gt;

Basically, it means that any thread before performing an update on a <code>Hashtable</code> will have to acquire a lock on the object while others will wait for lock to be released.</li>\n<li>Fail-safe is relevant within the context of iterators. If an iterator has been created on a collection object and some other thread tries to modify the collection object \"structurally\", a concurrent modification exception will be thrown.

Collection views greatly enhance the\n expressiveness of the interface, as discussed later in this section.\n Map allows you to iterate over keys, values, or key-value pairs;\n <code>Hashtable</code> does not provide the third option. Map provides a safe way\n to remove entries in the midst of iteration; <code>Hashtable</code> did not.\n Finally, Map fixes a minor deficiency in the <code>Hashtable</code> interface.\n <code>Hashtable</code> has a method called contains, which returns true if the\n <code>Hashtable</code> contains a given value. Given its name, you'd expect this\n method to return true if the <code>Hashtable</code> contained a given key, because\n the key is the primary access mechanism for a <code>Hashtable</code>. The Map\n interface eliminates this source of confusion by renaming the method\n <code>containsValue</code>. Also, this improves the interface's consistency —\n <code>containsValue</code> parallels <code>containsKey</code>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/map.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Map Interface</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":1900,"user_id":283519,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e60903f1cfe943d420b047006475e66?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"pwes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/283519/pwes"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":36,"last_activity_date":1417335110,"last_edit_date":1495542893,"creation_date":1326359836,"answer_id":8832544,"question_id":40471,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>Beside all the other important aspects already mentioned here, Collections API (e.g. Map interface) is being modified all the time to conform to the \"latest and greatest\" additions to Java spec.</p>\n\n<p>For example, compare Java 5 Map iterating:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (Elem elem : map.keys()) {\n  elem.doSth();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>versus the old Hashtable approach:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (Enumeration en = htable.keys(); en.hasMoreElements(); ) {\n  Elem elem = (Elem) en.nextElement();\n  elem.doSth();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In Java 1.8 we are also promised to be able to construct and access HashMaps like in good old scripting languages:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Map&lt;String,Integer&gt; map = { \"orange\" : 12, \"apples\" : 15 };\nmap[\"apples\"];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> No, they won't land in 1.8... :(</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13692213/are-project-coins-collection-enhancements-going-to-be-in-jdk8\">Are Project Coin&#39;s collection enhancements going to be in JDK8?</a></p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":18940,"user_id":1140748,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc97b9d2fe6e0197b6fff186af8133d4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"alain.janinm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1140748/alain-janinm"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":30,"last_activity_date":1335707866,"creation_date":1335707866,"answer_id":10372667,"question_id":40471,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">HashTable</a> is synchronized, if you are using it in a single thread you can use <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">HashMap</a>, which is an unsynchronized version.

However, the <code>Hashtable</code> implementation provides better and finer control over the hashing if you know what you are doing, namely you can fix the table size using e.g. the closest prime number to your values domain size and this will result in better performance than HashMap i.e. less collisions for some cases.</p>\n\n<p>Separate from the obvious differences discussed extensively in this question, I see the Hashtable as a \"manual drive\" car where you have better control over the hashing and the HashMap as the \"automatic drive\" counterpart that will generally perform well.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4688,"user_id":926520,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cIuFJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pankaj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/926520/pankaj"},"edited":false,"score":4,"creation_date":1359407589,"post_id":14452144,"comment_id":20333939,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"HashMap iterator is fail-fast not fail-safe.

As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, Hashtable class\n  was retrofitted to implement the Map interface, making it a member of\n  the Java Collections Framework.</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li><p>One of the major differences between HashMap and Hashtable is that HashMap is non-synchronized whereas Hashtable is synchronized, which\n  means Hashtable is thread-safe and can be shared between multiple\n  threads but HashMap cannot be shared between multiple threads without\n  proper synchronization. Java 5 introduced ConcurrentHashMap which is\n  an alternative of Hashtable and provides better scalability than\n  Hashtable in Java.Synchronized means only one thread can modify a hash\n  table at one point of time. Basically, it means that any thread before\n  performing an update on a hashtable will have to acquire a lock on the\n  object while others will wait for lock to be released.</p></li>\n  <li><p>The HashMap class is roughly equivalent to Hashtable, except that it permits nulls. (HashMap allows null values as key and value whereas\n  Hashtable doesn’t allow nulls).</p></li>\n  <li><p>The third significant difference between HashMap vs Hashtable is that Iterator in the HashMap is a fail-fast iterator while the\n  enumerator for the Hashtable is not and throw\n  ConcurrentModificationException if any other Thread modifies the map\n  structurally by adding or removing any element except Iterator’s own\n  remove() method.

Well, let's consider the following program.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class PlusEquals {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        byte a = 1;\n        byte b = 2;\n        a = a + b;\n        System.out.println(a);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What does this program print?</p>\n\n<p>Did you guess 3?

Well, it so happens that addition of bytes in Java <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.6.2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">is defined to return an <code>int</code></a>. This, I believe was because the Java Virtual Machine doesn't define byte operations to save on bytecodes (there is a limited number of those, after all), using integer operations instead is an implementation detail exposed in a language.</p>\n\n<p>But if <code>a = a + b</code> doesn't work, that would mean <code>a += b</code> would never work for bytes if it <code>E1 += E2</code> was defined to be <code>E1 = E1 + E2</code>. As the previous example shows, that would be indeed the case. As a hack to make <code>+=</code> operator work for bytes and shorts, there is an implicit cast involved. It's not that great of a hack, but back during the Java 1.0 work, the focus was on getting the language released to begin with. Now, because of backwards compatibility, this hack introduced in Java 1.0 couldn't be removed.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"reputation":36138,"user_id":1127571,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/00735aa8e45c6a3f4a79efe9cf689e40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Honza Brabec","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1127571/honza-brabec"},"comment_count":12,"is_answered":true,"view_count":301734,"protected_date":1361956091,"accepted_answer_id":8710685,"answer_count":11,"score":3715,"last_activity_date":1586429652,"creation_date":1325585432,"last_edit_date":1536651457,"question_id":8710619,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8710619/why-dont-javas-compound-assignment-operators-require-casting","title":"Why don&#39;t Java&#39;s +=, -=, *=, /= compound assignment operators require casting?","body":"<p>Until today, I thought that for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>i += j;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Was just a shortcut for:</p>\n\n<pre><code>i = i + j;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But if we try this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int i = 5;\nlong j = 8;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then <code>i = i + j;</code> will not compile but <code>i += j;</code> will compile fine.</p>\n\n<p>Does it mean that in fact <code>i += j;</code> is a shortcut for something like this\n<code>i = (type of i) (i + j)</code>?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","random","integer"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2993,"user_id":132162,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e05ab5ffe3b7b0bc5a9f4aeaa847564?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"raupach","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/132162/raupach"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1229163528,"post_id":363681,"comment_id":109286950,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 2.5","body":"When you need a lot of random numbers, I do not recommend the Random class in the API.

Any value from <code>Math.random()</code> greater than 0.6 will make the expression evaluate to 6 or greater, and adding 5 makes it greater than 10 (your maximum). The problem is you are multiplying the random number by the maximum (which generates a number almost as big as the maximum) and then adding the minimum. Unless the minimum is 1, it's not correct. You have to switch to, as mentioned in other answers</p>\n\n<pre><code>randomNum = minimum + (int)(Math.random()*(maximum-minimum+1))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The +1 is because <code>Math.random()</code> will never return 1.0.</p>\n\n<p>Solution 2:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Random rn = new Random();\nint n = maximum - minimum + 1;\nint i = rn.nextInt() % n;\nrandomNum =  minimum + i;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Your problem here is that '%' may return a negative number if the first term is smaller than 0. Since <code>rn.nextInt()</code> returns negative values with ~50% chance, you will also not get the expected result.</p>\n\n<p>This, was, however, almost perfect. You just had to look a bit further down the Javadoc, <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Random.html#nextInt%28int%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">nextInt(int n)</a>. With that method available, doing</p>\n\n<pre><code>Random rn = new Random();\nint n = maximum - minimum + 1;\nint i = rn.nextInt(n);\nrandomNum =  minimum + i;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Would also return the desired result.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":481,"user_id":3147737,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YHlHB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"f3d0r","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3147737/f3d0r"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1461218714,"last_edit_date":1461218714,"creation_date":1400973672,"answer_id":23850587,"question_id":363681,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>You can either use the Random class to generate a random number and then use the .nextInt(maxNumber) to generate a random number.

Consider a scenario where you would load a private RSA key from a PKCS#12 file, using it to perform some operation.

The desired information can be leaked manifold, core dumps, a debugger session or swap files are just some examples.</p>\n\n<p>And as it turns out, there is nothing that lets you clear the private information of a <code>PrivateKey</code> from memory, because there's no API that lets you wipe the bytes that form the corresponding information.</p>\n\n<p>This is a bad situation, as this <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.77.3297&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">paper</a> describes how this circumstance could be potentially exploited.</p>\n\n<p>The OpenSSL library for example overwrites critical memory sections before private keys are freed.

Since Strings are immutable there is no way the contents of Strings can be changed because any change will produce a new String, while if you use a char[] you can still set all the elements as blank or zero. So storing a password in a character array clearly mitigates the security risk of stealing a password.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.</strong>  Java itself recommends using the getPassword() method of JPasswordField which returns a char[], instead of the deprecated getText() method which returns passwords in clear text stating security reasons. It's good to follow advice from the Java team and adhere to standards rather than going against them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3.</strong>  With String there is always a risk of printing plain text in a log file or console but if you use an Array you won't print contents of an array, but instead its memory location gets printed. Though not a real reason, it still makes sense.</p>\n\n<pre><code>String strPassword=\"Unknown\";\nchar[] charPassword= new char[]{'U','n','k','w','o','n'};\nSystem.out.println(\"String password: \" + strPassword);\nSystem.out.println(\"Character password: \" + charPassword);\n\nString password: Unknown\nCharacter password: [C@110b053\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Referenced from <a href=\"http://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/03/why-character-array-is-better-than.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this blog</a>.\nI hope this helps.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":235291,"user_id":2711488,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FhkI9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Holger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2711488/holger"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1489081527,"post_id":28123411,"comment_id":72526169,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"Why is String-deduplication scary?

But you may find 3rd-party implementations implementing the older interface only.</p>\n\n<h2>Natural order</h2>\n\n<p>If you want a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>Map</code></a> that keeps its pairs arranged by the “natural order” of the key, use <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/TreeMap.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>TreeMap</code></a> or <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentSkipListMap.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>ConcurrentSkipListMap</code></a>. The term “natural order” means the class of the keys implements <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Comparable.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>Comparable</code></a>. The value returned by the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Comparable.html#compareTo(T)\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>compareTo</code></a> method is used for comparison in sorting.</p>\n\n<h2>Custom order</h2>\n\n<p>If you want to specify a custom sorting routine for your keys to be used in maintaining a sorted order, pass a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Comparator.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>Comparator</code></a> implementation appropriate to the class of your keys. Use either <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/TreeMap.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>TreeMap</code></a> or <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentSkipListMap.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>ConcurrentSkipListMap</code></a>, passing your <code>Comparator</code>. </p>\n\n<h2>Original insertion order</h2>\n\n<p>If you want the pairs of your map to be kept in their original order in which you inserted them into the map, use <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>LinkedHashMap</code></a>. </p>\n\n<h2>Enum-definition order</h2>\n\n<p>If you are using an enum such as <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/DayOfWeek.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>DayOfWeek</code></a> or <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Month.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>Month</code></a> as your keys, use the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/EnumMap.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>EnumMap</code></a> class. Not only is this class <em>highly</em> optimized to use very little memory and run very fast, it maintains your pairs in the order defined by the enum. For <code>DayOfWeek</code>, for example, the key of <code>DayOfWeek.MONDAY</code> will be first found when iterated, and the key of <code>DayOfWeek.SUNDAY</code> will be last.</p>\n\n<h2>Other considerations</h2>\n\n<p>In choosing a <code>Map</code> implementation, also consider:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>NULLs.

Let's go over the most common methods and review their advantages and disadvantages. Since all maps in Java implement the Map interface, the following techniques will work for any map implementation (<code>HashMap</code>, <code>TreeMap</code>, <code>LinkedHashMap</code>, <code>Hashtable</code>, etc.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method #1</strong>: Iterating over entries using a For-Each loop.</p>\n\n<p>This is the most common method and is preferable in most cases. It should be used if you need both map keys and values in the loop.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Map&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;();\nfor (Map.Entry&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; entry : map.entrySet()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + entry.getKey() + \", Value = \" + entry.getValue());\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that the For-Each loop was introduced in Java 5, so this method is working only in newer versions of the language. Also a For-Each loop will throw <code>NullPointerException</code> if you try to iterate over a map that is null, so before iterating you should always check for null references.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method #2</strong>: Iterating over keys or values using a For-Each loop.</p>\n\n<p>If you need only keys or values from the map, you can iterate over keySet or values instead of entrySet.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Map&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;();\n\n// Iterating over keys only\nfor (Integer key : map.keySet()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + key);\n}\n\n// Iterating over values only\nfor (Integer value : map.values()) {\n    System.out.println(\"Value = \" + value);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This method gives a slight performance advantage over <code>entrySet</code> iteration (about 10% faster) and is more clean.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method #3</strong>: Iterating using Iterator.</p>\n\n<p>Using Generics:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Map&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;();\nIterator&lt;Map.Entry&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;&gt; entries = map.entrySet().iterator();\nwhile (entries.hasNext()) {\n    Map.Entry&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; entry = entries.next();\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + entry.getKey() + \", Value = \" + entry.getValue());\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Without Generics:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Map map = new HashMap();\nIterator entries = map.entrySet().iterator();\nwhile (entries.hasNext()) {\n    Map.Entry entry = (Map.Entry) entries.next();\n    Integer key = (Integer)entry.getKey();\n    Integer value = (Integer)entry.getValue();\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + key + \", Value = \" + value);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can also use same technique to iterate over <code>keySet</code> or values.</p>\n\n<p>This method might look redundant, but it has its own advantages. First of all, it is the only way to iterate over a map in older versions of Java. The other important feature is that it is the only method that allows you to remove entries from the map during iteration by calling <code>iterator.remove()</code>. If you try to do this during For-Each iteration you will get \"unpredictable results\" according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc\">Javadoc</a>.</p>\n\n<p>From a performance point of view this method is equal to a For-Each iteration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Method #4</strong>: Iterating over keys and searching for values (inefficient).</p>\n\n<pre><code>Map&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;();\nfor (Integer key : map.keySet()) {\n    Integer value = map.get(key);\n    System.out.println(\"Key = \" + key + \", Value = \" + value);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This might look like a cleaner alternative for method #1, but in practice it is pretty slow and inefficient as getting values by a key might be time-consuming (this method in different Map implementations is 20%-200% slower than method #1). If you have FindBugs installed, it will detect this and warn you about inefficient iteration. This method should be avoided.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you need only keys or values from the map, use method #2. If you are stuck with older version of Java (less than 5) or planning to remove entries during iteration, you have to use method #3. Otherwise use method #1.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"reputation":53600,"user_id":84916,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IaDb2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"burntsugar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/84916/burntsugar"},"comment_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":3951732,"protected_date":1386076986,"closed_date":1573200556,"accepted_answer_id":1066603,"answer_count":7,"score":3500,"last_activity_date":1573200548,"creation_date":1246404254,"last_edit_date":1572364824,"question_id":1066589,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1066589/iterate-through-a-hashmap","closed_reason":"Duplicate","title":"Iterate through a HashMap","body":"<p>What's the best way to iterate over the items in a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>HashMap</code></a>?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","memory","memory-leaks"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":273369,"user_id":40342,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a648ccb47bbbe9497c073315aac4d33e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Joachim Sauer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/40342/joachim-sauer"},"edited":false,"score":23,"creation_date":1308932111,"post_id":6470679,"comment_id":7602763,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"That depends on the definition of &quot;memory leak&quot;.

Or at least how JDBC expects a developer to close <code>Connection</code>, <code>Statement</code> and <code>ResultSet</code> instances before discarding them or losing references to them, instead of relying on the implementation of <code>finalize</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>void doWork()\n{\n   try\n   {\n       Connection conn = ConnectionFactory.getConnection();\n       PreparedStatement stmt = conn.preparedStatement(\"some query\"); // executes a valid query\n       ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery();\n       while(rs.hasNext())\n       {\n          ... process the result set\n       }\n   }\n   catch(SQLException sqlEx)\n   {\n       log(sqlEx);\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem with the above is that the <code>Connection</code> object is not closed, and hence the physical connection will remain open, until the garbage collector comes around and sees that it is unreachable. GC will invoke the <code>finalize</code> method, but there are JDBC drivers that do not implement the <code>finalize</code>, at least not in the same way that <code>Connection.close</code> is implemented. The resulting behavior is that while memory will be reclaimed due to unreachable objects being collected, resources (including memory) associated with the <code>Connection</code> object might simply not be reclaimed.</p>\n\n<p>In such an event where the <code>Connection</code>'s <code>finalize</code> method does not clean up everything, one might actually find that the physical connection to the database server will last several garbage collection cycles, until the database server eventually figures out that the connection is not alive (if it does), and should be closed.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the JDBC driver were to implement <code>finalize</code>, it is possible for exceptions to be thrown during finalization. The resulting behavior is that any memory associated with the now \"dormant\" object will not be reclaimed, as <code>finalize</code> is guaranteed to be invoked only once.</p>\n\n<p>The above scenario of encountering exceptions during object finalization is related to another other scenario that could possibly lead to a memory leak - object resurrection. Object resurrection is often done intentionally by creating a strong reference to the object from being finalized, from another object. When object resurrection is misused it will lead to a memory leak in combination with other sources of memory leaks.</p>\n\n<p>There are plenty more examples that you can conjure up - like</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Managing a <code>List</code> instance where you are only adding to the list and not deleting from it (although you should be getting rid of elements you no longer need), or</li>\n<li>Opening <code>Socket</code>s or <code>File</code>s, but not closing them when they are no longer needed (similar to the above example involving the <code>Connection</code> class).</li>\n<li>Not unloading Singletons when bringing down a Java EE application. Apparently, the Classloader that loaded the singleton class will retain a reference to the class, and hence the singleton instance will never be collected. When a new instance of the application is deployed, a new class loader is usually created, and the former class loader will continue to exist due to the singleton.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6504,"user_id":573057,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f857595894d2c4009a790ebf473a4334?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"earcam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/573057/earcam"},"edited":false,"score":197,"creation_date":1309193716,"post_id":6471947,"comment_id":7639896,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"+1 ClassLoader leaks are some of the most commonly painful memory leaks in the JEE world, often caused by 3rd party libs that transform data (BeanUtils, XML/JSON codecs).

Allocating the extra memory is optional (leaking the class instance is enough), but it will make the leak work that much faster.</li>\n<li>The application clears all references to the custom class or the <code>ClassLoader</code> it was loaded from.</li>\n<li>Repeat.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Due to the way <code>ThreadLocal</code> is implemented in Oracle's JDK, this creates a memory leak:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Each <code>Thread</code> has a private field <code>threadLocals</code>, which actually stores the thread-local values.</li>\n<li>Each <em>key</em> in this map is a weak reference to a <code>ThreadLocal</code> object, so after that <code>ThreadLocal</code> object is garbage-collected, its entry is removed from the map.</li>\n<li>But each <em>value</em> is a strong reference, so when a value (directly or indirectly) points to the <code>ThreadLocal</code> object that is its <em>key</em>, that object will neither be garbage-collected nor removed from the map as long as the thread lives.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In this example, the chain of strong references looks like this:</p>\n\n<p><code>Thread</code> object → <code>threadLocals</code> map → instance of example class → example class → static <code>ThreadLocal</code> field → <code>ThreadLocal</code> object.</p>\n\n<p>(The <code>ClassLoader</code> doesn't really play a role in creating the leak, it just makes the leak worse because of this additional reference chain: example class → <code>ClassLoader</code> → all the classes it has loaded. It was even worse in many JVM implementations, especially prior to Java 7, because classes and <code>ClassLoader</code>s were allocated straight into permgen and were never garbage-collected at all.)</p>\n\n<p>A variation on this pattern is why application containers (like Tomcat) can leak memory like a sieve if you frequently redeploy applications which happen to use <code>ThreadLocal</code>s that in some way point back to themselves.

JGroup has the leak in GossipRouter.</p></li>\n<li><p>Creating, but not starting, a <code>Thread</code> goes into the same category as above.</p></li>\n<li><p>Creating a thread inherits the <code>ContextClassLoader</code> and <code>AccessControlContext</code>, plus the <code>ThreadGroup</code> and any <code>InheritedThreadLocal</code>, all those references are potential leaks, along with the entire classes loaded by the classloader and all static references, and ja-ja. The effect is especially visible with the entire j.u.c.Executor framework that features a super simple <code>ThreadFactory</code> interface, yet most developers have no clue of the lurking danger. Also a lot of libraries do start threads upon request (way too many industry popular libraries).</p></li>\n<li><p><code>ThreadLocal</code> caches; those are evil in many cases. I am sure everyone has seen quite a bit of simple caches based on ThreadLocal, well the bad news: if the thread keeps going more than expected the life the context ClassLoader, it is a pure nice little leak. Do not use ThreadLocal caches unless really needed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Calling <code>ThreadGroup.destroy()</code> when the ThreadGroup has no threads itself, but it still keeps child ThreadGroups. A bad leak that will prevent the ThreadGroup to remove from its parent, but all the children become un-enumerateable.</p></li>\n<li><p>Using WeakHashMap and the value (in)directly references the key. This is a hard one to find without a heap dump. That applies to all extended <code>Weak/SoftReference</code> that might keep a hard reference back to the guarded object.</p></li>\n<li><p>Using <code>java.net.URL</code> with the HTTP(S) protocol and loading the resource from(!). This one is special, the <code>KeepAliveCache</code> creates a new thread in the system ThreadGroup which leaks the current thread's context classloader. The thread is created upon the first request when no alive thread exists, so either you may get lucky or just leak. <em>The leak is already fixed in Java&nbsp;7 and the code that creates thread properly removes the context classloader.</em> There are few more cases (<del>like ImageFetcher</del>, <em>also fixed</em>) of creating similar threads.</p></li>\n<li><p>Using <code>InflaterInputStream</code> passing <code>new java.util.zip.Inflater()</code> in the constructor (<code>PNGImageDecoder</code> for instance) and not calling <code>end()</code> of the inflater. Well, if you pass in the constructor with just <code>new</code>, no chance... And yes, calling <code>close()</code> on the stream does not close the inflater if it's manually passed as constructor parameter. This is not a true leak since it'd be released by the finalizer... when it deems it necessary. Till that moment it eats native memory so badly it can cause Linux oom_killer to kill the process with impunity. The main issue is that finalization in Java is very unreliable and G1 made it worse till 7.0.2. Moral of the story: release native resources as soon as you can; the finalizer is just too poor.</p></li>\n<li><p>The same case with <code>java.util.zip.Deflater</code>. This one is far worse since Deflater is memory hungry in Java, i.e. always uses 15&nbsp;bits (max) and 8&nbsp;memory levels (9 is max) allocating several hundreds KB of native memory. Fortunately, <code>Deflater</code> is not widely used and to my knowledge JDK contains no misuses. Always call <code>end()</code> if you manually create a <code>Deflater</code> or <code>Inflater</code>. The best part of the last two: <em>you can't find them via normal profiling tools available.</em></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>(I can add some more time wasters I have encountered upon request.)</em></p>\n\n<p>Good luck and stay safe; leaks are evil!</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":411,"user_id":60624,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/41f66d0289b4f1317755527ba432fd38?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ehabkost","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/60624/ehabkost"},"edited":false,"score":31,"creation_date":1311315156,"post_id":6545142,"comment_id":8052701,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"I find it funny that on other answers people are looking for those edge cases and tricks and seem to be completely missing the point.

They are edge cases. With these examples, the programmer made a mistake (like don't redefining equals/hashcode), or has been bitten by a corner case of the JVM/JAVA (load of class with static...). I think that's not the type of example an interviewer want or even the most common case.</p>\n\n<p>But there are really simpler cases for memory leaks. The garbage collector only frees what is no longer referenced. We as Java developers don't care about memory. We allocate it when needed and let it be freed automatically. Fine.</p>\n\n<p>But any long-lived application tend to have shared state. It can be anything, statics, singletons... Often non-trivial applications tend to make complex objects graphs. Just forgetting to set a reference to null or more often forgetting to remove one object from a collection is enough to make a memory leak.</p>\n\n<p>Of course all sort of listeners (like UI listeners), caches, or any long-lived shared state tend to produce memory leak if not properly handled. What shall be understood is that this is not a Java corner case, or a problem with the garbage collector. It is a design problem. We design that we add a listener to a long-lived object, but we don't remove the listener when no longer needed. We cache objects, but we have no strategy to remove them from the cache.</p>\n\n<p>We maybe have a complex graph that store the previous state that is needed by a computation. But the previous state is itself linked to the state before and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Like we have to close SQL connections or files. We need to set proper references to null and remove elements from the collection. We shall have proper caching strategies (maximum memory size, number of elements, or timers). All objects that allow a listener to be notified must provide both a addListener and removeListener method. And when these notifiers are no longer used, they must clear their listener list.</p>\n\n<p>A memory leak is indeed truly possible and is perfectly predictable. No need for special language features or corner cases. Memory leaks are either an indicator that something is maybe missing or even of design problems.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5234,"user_id":18796,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tR2iM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ian McLaird","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/18796/ian-mclaird"},"edited":false,"score":189,"creation_date":1310530131,"post_id":6548647,"comment_id":7892919,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"I&#39;d disagree that context and session attributes are &quot;leaks.&quot;  They&#39;re just long-lived variables.

The danger I&#39;ve run into isn&#39;t problems from memory being leaked by Streams.  The problem is that not enough memory is leaked by them.

This means the finalizer isn&#39;t called, so you run out of handles.

Java does automatic memory management and will free resources that are not needed for you. You can't stop this from happening. It will ALWAYS be able to release the resources. In programs with manual memory management, this is different. You cann get some memory in C using malloc(). To free the memory, you need the pointer that malloc returned and call free() on it. But if you don't have the pointer anymore (overwritten, or lifetime exceeded), then you are unfortunately incapable of freeing this memory and thus you have a memory leak.</p>\n\n<p>All the other answers so far are in my definition not really memory leaks. They all aim at filling the memory with pointless stuff real fast. But at any time you could still dereference the objects you created and thus freeing the memory --> NO LEAK. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/4948560/327301\">acconrad's answer</a> comes pretty close though as I have to admit since his solution is effectively to just \"crash\" the garbage collector by forcing it in an endless loop).</p>\n\n<p>The long answer is: You can get a memory leak by writing a library for Java using the JNI, which can have manual memory management and thus have memory leaks. If you call this library, your java process will leak memory. Or, you can have bugs in the JVM, so that the JVM looses memory. There are probably bugs in the JVM, there may even be some known ones since garbage collection is not that trivial, but then it's still a bug. By design this is not possible. You may be asking for some java code that is effected by such a bug. Sorry I don't know one and it might well not be a bug anymore in the next Java version anyway.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":7012,"user_id":368544,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1cd172ae553812ace293c4fe0142850b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mschonaker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/368544/mschonaker"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1311330284,"score":10,"last_activity_date":1309675791,"creation_date":1309675791,"answer_id":6561539,"question_id":6470651,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>I think that a valid example could be using ThreadLocal variables in an environment where threads are pooled. </p>\n\n<p>For instance, using ThreadLocal variables in Servlets to communicate with other web components, having the threads being created by the container and maintaining the idle ones in a pool.

Since servers do not run IDEs or their (as likely instrumented) run-time environments, it is dangerous to make any presumptions or cases around what a given IDE does or doesn&#39;t do.

The granularity at which NDC works is threads, so it distinguishes log outputs from different threads separately.</p>\n\n<p>In order to store thread specific tags, log4j's NDC class uses a Hashtable which is keyed by the Thread object itself (as opposed to say the thread id), and thus till the NDC tag stays in memory all the objects that hang off of the thread object also stay in memory. In our web application we use NDC to tag logoutputs with a request id to distinguish logs from a single request separately. The container that associates the NDC tag with a thread, also removes it while returning the response from a request. The problem occurred when during the course of processing a request, a child thread was spawned, something like the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>pubclic class RequestProcessor {\n    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(RequestProcessor.class);\n    public void doSomething()  {\n        ....\n        final List&lt;String&gt; hugeList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(10000);\n        new Thread() {\n           public void run() {\n               logger.info(\"Child thread spawned\")\n               for(String s:hugeList) {\n                   ....\n               }\n           }\n        }.start();\n    }\n}    \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So an NDC context was associated with inline thread that was spawned. The thread object that was the key for this NDC context, is the inline thread which has the hugeList object hanging off of it. Hence even after the thread finished doing what it was doing, the reference to the hugeList was kept alive by the NDC context Hastable, thus causing a memory leak.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":9538,"user_id":1169349,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12190e569661586c67fb666370343c80?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Reg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1169349/reg"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1441187506,"post_id":6782636,"comment_id":52573065,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"Based on a true story."}],"owner":{"reputation":14510,"user_id":73274,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f22abfd0e934eac307239b636357ada8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Paul Morie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/73274/paul-morie"},"comment_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1311330284,"score":19,"last_activity_date":1311281560,"creation_date":1311281560,"answer_id":6782636,"question_id":6470651,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>Everyone always forgets the native code route.

The bigger the jar file, the quicker memory gets allocated.</p>\n\n<p>You can easily create such a jar with the following class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.io.File;\nimport java.io.FileOutputStream;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.zip.ZipEntry;\nimport java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream;\n\npublic class BigJarCreator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        ZipOutputStream zos = new ZipOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(new File(\"big.jar\")));\n        zos.putNextEntry(new ZipEntry(\"resource.txt\"));\n        zos.write(\"not too much in here\".getBytes());\n        zos.closeEntry();\n        zos.putNextEntry(new ZipEntry(\"largeFile.out\"));\n        for (int i=0 ; i&lt;10000000 ; i++) {\n            zos.write((int) (Math.round(Math.random()*100)+20));\n        }\n        zos.closeEntry();\n        zos.close();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Just paste into a file named BigJarCreator.java, compile and run it from command line: </p>\n\n<pre><code>javac BigJarCreator.java\njava -cp . BigJarCreator\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Et voilà: you find a jar archive in your current working directory with two files inside.</p>\n\n<p>Let's create a second class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MemLeak {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {\n        int ITERATIONS=100000;\n        for (int i=0 ; i&lt;ITERATIONS ; i++) {\n            MemLeak.class.getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(\"resource.txt\");\n        }\n        System.out.println(\"finished creation of streams, now waiting to be killed\");\n\n        Thread.sleep(Long.MAX_VALUE);\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This class basically does nothing, but create unreferenced InputStream objects. Those objects will be garbage collected immediately and thus, do not contribute to heap size.\nIt is important for our example to load an existing resource from a jar file, and size does matter here!</p>\n\n<p>If you're doubtful, try to compile and start the class above, but make sure to chose a decent heap size (2 MB):</p>\n\n<pre><code>javac MemLeak.java\njava -Xmx2m -classpath .:big.jar MemLeak\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You will not encounter an OOM error here, as no references are kept, the application will keep running no matter how large you chose ITERATIONS in the above example.\nThe memory consumption of your process (visible in top (RES/RSS) or process explorer) grows unless the application gets to the wait command. In the setup above, it will allocate around 150 MB in memory.</p>\n\n<p>If you want the application to play safe, close the input stream right where it's created:</p>\n\n<pre><code>MemLeak.class.getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(\"resource.txt\").close();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and your process will not exceed 35 MB, independent of the iteration count.</p>\n\n<p>Quite simple and surprising.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":669,"user_id":466250,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc492e1bdec1ee598989734013b08058?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jorgeu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/466250/jorgeu"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1348778734,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1348778734,"creation_date":1348778734,"answer_id":12629746,"question_id":6470651,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>Swing has it very easy with dialogs.

The thread can check the variable periodically and use that as a signal to terminate. If the variable is not declared <code>volatile</code>, then the change to the variable might not be seen by the thread, so it won't know to terminate. Or imagine if some threads want to update a shared object, but deadlock while trying to lock on it.</p>\n\n<p>If you only have a handful of threads these bugs will probably be obvious because your program will stop working properly. If you have a thread pool that creates more threads as needed, then the obsolete/stuck threads might not be noticed, and will accumulate indefinitely, causing a memory leak.

A mark and sweep\n  garbage collection consists of two phases, the mark phase and the\n  sweep phase.</p>\n  \n  <p>During the mark phase <strong>all objects that are reachable from Java\n  threads, native handles and other root sources are marked as alive</strong>, as\n  well as the objects that are reachable from these objects and so\n  forth. <strong>This process identifies and marks all objects that are still\n  used, and the rest can be considered garbage.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>During the sweep phase the heap is traversed to find the gaps between\n  the live objects. These gaps are recorded in a free list and are made\n  available for new object allocation.</p>\n  \n  <p>The JRockit JVM uses two improved versions of the mark and sweep\n  model. One is mostly concurrent mark and sweep and the other is\n  parallel mark and sweep. You can also mix the two strategies, running\n  for example mostly concurrent mark and parallel sweep.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, to create a memory leak in Java; the easiest way to do that is to create a database connection, do some work, and simply not <code>Close()</code> it; then generate a new database connection while staying in scope. This isn't hard to do in a loop for example. If you have a worker that pulls from a queue and pushes to a database you can easily create a memory leak by forgetting to <code>Close()</code> connections or opening them when not necessary, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, you'll consume the heap that has been allocated to the JVM by forgetting to <code>Close()</code> the connection. This will result in the JVM garbage collecting like crazy; eventually resulting in <code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space</code> errors. It should be noted that the error may not mean there is a memory leak; it could just mean you don't have enough memory; databases like Cassandra and ElasticSearch for example can throw that error because they don't have enough heap space.</p>\n\n<p>Its worth noting that this is true for all GC languages. Below, are some examples I've seen working as an SRE:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Node using Redis as a queue; the development team created new connections every 12 hours and forgot to close the old ones. Eventually node was OOMd because it consumed all the memory.</li>\n<li>Golang (I'm guilty of this one); parsing large json files with <code>json.Unmarshal</code> and then passing the results by reference and keeping them open. Eventually, this resulted in the entire heap being consumed by accidental refs I kept open to decode json.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":482,"user_id":2292492,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CD9c7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"deltamind106","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2292492/deltamind106"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1507921764,"score":22,"last_activity_date":1507921764,"creation_date":1507921764,"answer_id":46736578,"question_id":6470651,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>The interviewer was probably looking for a circular reference like the code below (which incidentally only leak memory in very old JVMs that used reference counting, which isn't the case any more).

This  is  because  the\nstack  maintains obsolete references to these objects. An obsolete\nreference is simply a reference that will never be dereferenced\nagain. In this case, any references outside of the “active portion” of\nthe element array are obsolete. The active portion consists of the\nelements whose index is less than size</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here is the solution of the book to tackle this memory leak:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The  fix  for  this  sort  of  problem  is  simple:  null  out\nreferences  once  they become obsolete. In the case of our Stack class,\nthe reference to an item becomes obsolete  as  soon  as  it’s  popped\noff  the  stack. The  corrected  version  of  the  pop method looks like this:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>public Object pop() {\n    if (size == 0) throw new EmptyStackException();\n    Object result = elements[--size];\n    elements[size] = null; // Eliminate obsolete reference\n    return result;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>But how can we prevent a memory leak from happening? This is a good caveat from the book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Generally  speaking,  whenever  a  class  manages  its  own  memory,\nthe  programmer should be alert for memory leaks. Whenever an element\nis freed, any object references contained in the element should be\nnulled out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">observer pattern</a> also can cause a memory leak. You can read about this pattern in the following link: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Observer pattern</a>.</p>\n<p>This is one implementation of <code>Observer</code> pattern:</p>\n<pre><code>class EventSource {\n    public interface Observer {\n        void update(String event);\n    }\n\n    private final List&lt;Observer&gt; observers = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n\n    private void notifyObservers(String event) {\n        observers.forEach(observer -&gt; observer.update(event)); //alternative lambda expression: observers.forEach(Observer::update);\n    }\n\n    public void addObserver(Observer observer) {\n        observers.add(observer);\n    }\n\n    public void scanSystemIn() {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n            String line = scanner.nextLine();\n            notifyObservers(line);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this implementation, <code>EventSource</code>, which is Observable in <code>Observer</code> design pattern, can hold link to <code>Obeserver</code> objects, but this link is never removed from the <code>observers</code> field in <code>EventSource</code>. So they will never be collected by the garbage collector.

Perl has no formal protections which is perhaps why I understand the problem so well :) )</p>\n\n<h2>Private</h2>\n\n<p>Like you'd think, only the <strong>class</strong> in which it is declared can see it.</p>\n\n<h2>Package Private</h2>\n\n<p>It can only be seen and used by the <strong>package</strong> in which it was declared.  This is the default in Java (which some see as a mistake).</p>\n\n<h2>Protected</h2>\n\n<p>Package Private + can be seen by subclasses or package members.</p>\n\n<h2>Public</h2>\n\n<p>Everyone can see it.</p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/published.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Published</a></h2>\n\n<p>Visible outside the code I control.  (While not Java syntax, it is important for this discussion).</p>\n\n<p>C++ defines an additional level called \"friend\" and the less you know about that the better.</p>\n\n<p>When should you use what?  The whole idea is encapsulation to hide information.  As much as possible you want to hide the detail of how something is done from your users.  Why?  Because then you can change them later and not break anybody's code.  This lets you optimize, refactor, redesign, and fix bugs without worry that someone was using that code you just overhauled.</p>\n\n<p>So, the rule of thumb is to make things only as visible as they have to be.  Start with private and only add more visibility as needed.  Only make public that which is absolutely necessary for the user to know, every detail you make public cramps your ability to redesign the system.</p>\n\n<p>If you want users to be able to customize behaviors, rather than making internals public so they can override them, it's often a better idea to shove those guts into an object and make that interface public.  That way they can simply plug in a new object.  For example, if you were writing a CD player and wanted the \"go find info about this CD\" bit customizable, rather than make those methods public you'd put all that functionality into its own object and make just your object getter/setter public.  In this way being stingy about exposing your guts encourages good composition and separation of concerns</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I stick with just \"private\" and \"public\".  Many OO languages just have that.  \"Protected\" can be handy, but it's really a cheat.  Once an interface is more than private it's outside of your control and you have to go looking in other people's code to find uses.</p>\n\n<p>This is where the idea of \"published\" comes in.  Changing an interface (refactoring it) requires that you find all the code which is using it and change that, too.  If the interface is private, well no problem.  If it's protected you have to go find all your subclasses.  If it's public you have to go find all the code which uses your code.  Sometimes this is possible, for example, if you're working on corporate code that's for internal use only it doesn't matter if an interface is public.  You can grab all the code out of the corporate repository.  But if an interface is \"published\", if there is code using it outside your control, then you're hosed.  You must support that interface or risk breaking code.  Even protected interfaces can be considered published (which is why I don't bother with protected).</p>\n\n<p>Many languages find the hierarchical nature of public/protected/private to be too limiting and not in line with reality.  To that end, there is the concept of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_class\" rel=\"noreferrer\">trait class</a>, but that's another show.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":2526,"user_id":26010,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/14ef739d471d306d7ff10fc0ccfd0120?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dov Wasserman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/26010/dov-wasserman"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":9,"last_activity_date":1510438975,"last_edit_date":1510438975,"creation_date":1224386287,"answer_id":215951,"question_id":215497,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>David's answer provides the meaning of each access modifier.

The grid tells you whether an access is allowed, but what exactly constitutes an access? Also, access levels interact with nested classes and inheritance in complex ways.</p>\n\n<p>The \"default\" access (specified by the absence of a keyword) is also called <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5416074/java-package-private-terminology\"><strong>package-private</strong></a>. Exception: in an interface, no modifier means public access; modifiers other than public are forbidden. Enum constants are always public.</p>\n\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n\n<p>Is an access to a member with this access specifier allowed?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Member is <code>private</code>: Only if member is defined within the same class as calling code.</li>\n<li>Member is package private: Only if the calling code is within the member's immediately enclosing package.</li>\n<li>Member is <code>protected</code>: Same package, or if member is defined in a superclass of the class containing the calling code.</li>\n<li>Member is <code>public</code>: Yes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What access specifiers apply to</h2>\n\n<p>Local variables and formal parameters cannot take access specifiers. Since they are inherently inaccessible to the outside according to scoping rules, they are effectively private.</p>\n\n<p>For classes in the top scope, only <code>public</code> and package-private are permitted. This design choice is presumably because <code>protected</code> and <code>private</code> would be redundant at the package level (there is no inheritance of packages).</p>\n\n<p>All the access specifiers are possible on class members (constructors, methods and static member functions, nested classes).</p>\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/267781/java-class-accessibility\">Java Class Accessibility</a></p>\n\n<h2>Order</h2>\n\n<p>The access specifiers can be strictly ordered</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>public > protected > package-private > private</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>meaning that <code>public</code> provides the most access, <code>private</code> the least. Any reference possible on a private member is also valid for a package-private member; any reference to a package-private member is valid on a protected member, and so on. (Giving access to protected members to other classes in the same package was considered a mistake.)</p>\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/676930/private-member-access-java\">A class's methods <em>are</em> allowed to access private members of other objects of the same class.</a> More precisely, a method of class C can access private members of C on objects of any subclass of C. Java doesn't support restricting access by instance, only by class. (Compare with Scala, which does support it using <code>private[this]</code>.)</li>\n<li>You need access to a constructor to construct an object. Thus if all constructors are private, the class can only be constructed by code living within the class (typically static factory methods or static variable initializers). Similarly for package-private or protected constructors.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Only having private constructors also means that the class cannot be subclassed externally, since Java requires a subclass's constructors to implicitly or explicitly call a superclass constructor. (It can, however, contain a nested class that subclasses it.)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Inner classes</h2>\n\n<p>You also have to consider <em>nested</em> scopes, such as inner classes. An example of the complexity is that inner classes have members, which themselves can take access modifiers. So you can have a private inner class with a public member; can the member be accessed? (See below.) The general rule is to look at scope and think recursively to see whether you can access each level.</p>\n\n<p>However, this is quite complicated, and for full details, <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-6.html#jls-6.6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">consult the Java Language Specification</a>. (Yes, there have been compiler bugs in the past.)</p>\n\n<p>For a taste of how these interact, consider this example.

There are two levels\n  of access control:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>At the top level—public, or package-private (no explicit modifier).</li>\n  <li>At the member level—public, private, protected, or package-private (no explicit modifier).  </li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>A class may be declared with the modifier public, in which case that\n  class is visible to all classes everywhere. If a class has no modifier\n  (the default, also known as package-private), it is visible only\n  within its own package</p>\n  \n  <p>The following table shows the access to members permitted by each\n  modifier.</p>\n\n<pre><code>╔═════════════╦═══════╦═════════╦══════════╦═══════╗\n║ Modifier    ║ Class ║ Package ║ Subclass ║ World ║\n╠═════════════╬═══════╬═════════╬══════════╬═══════╣\n║ public      ║ Y     ║ Y       ║ Y        ║ Y     ║\n║ protected   ║ Y     ║ Y       ║ Y        ║ N     ║\n║ no modifier ║ Y     ║ Y       ║ N        ║ N     ║\n║ private     ║ Y     ║ N       ║ N        ║ N     ║\n╚═════════════╩═══════╩═════════╩══════════╩═══════╝\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>The first data column indicates whether the class itself has access to\n  the member defined by the access level.

First, when you use classes that\n  come from another source, such as the classes in the Java platform,\n  access levels determine which members of those classes your own\n  classes can use.

In these other classes (within same package), you can access these default members on instance of Class1. Also you can access these default members within subclasses of Class1, say Class2 (on this reference or on instance of Class1 or on instance of Class2). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Basically, within same package you can access default members on instance of class directly or on 'this' reference in subclasses.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>protected</strong>:\nThis access specifier will provide access specified by package-private access specifier in addition to access described below.</p>\n\n<p>When you are developing some package and hence some class (say Class1) within it, then you should use protected access specifier for data member within Class1 if you don't want this member to be accessed outside your package (say in package of consumer of your package i.e. client who is using your APIs) in general, but you want to make an exception and allow access to this member only if client writes class say Class2 that extends Class1. So, in general, protected members will be accessible on 'this' reference in derived classes i.e. Class2 and also on explicit instances of Class2.</p>\n\n<p>Please note:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You won't be able to access inherited protected member of Class1 in\nClass2, if you attempt to access it on explicit instance of Class1,\nalthough it is inherited in it.</li>\n<li>When you write another class Class3 within same/different package\nthat extends Class2, protected member from Class1 will be accessible\non this reference and also on explicit instance of Class3. This will\nbe true for any hierarchy that is extended i.e. protected member\nwill still be accessible on this reference or instance of extended\nclass.

In other words, you can walk the list forwards or backwards, but finding a position in the list takes time proportional to the size of the list. Javadoc says <em>&quot;operations that index into the list will traverse the list from the beginning or the end, whichever is closer&quot;</em>, so those methods are <em>O(n)</em> (<em>n/4</em> steps) on average, though <em>O(1)</em> for <code>index = 0</code>.</p>\n<p><code>ArrayList&lt;E&gt;</code>, on the other hand, allow fast random read access, so you can grab any element in constant time. But adding or removing from anywhere but the end requires shifting all the latter elements over, either to make an opening or fill the gap. Also, if you add more elements than the capacity of the underlying array, a new array (1.5 times the size) is allocated, and the old array is copied to the new one, so adding to an <code>ArrayList</code> is <em>O(n)</em> in the worst case but constant on average.</p>\n<p>So depending on the operations you intend to do, you should choose the implementations accordingly. Iterating over either kind of List is practically equally cheap. (Iterating over an <code>ArrayList</code> is technically faster, but unless you're doing something really performance-sensitive, you shouldn't worry about this -- they're both constants.)</p>\n<p>The main benefits of using a <code>LinkedList</code> arise when you re-use existing iterators to insert and remove elements. These operations can then be done in <em>O(1)</em> by changing the list locally only. In an array list, the remainder of the array needs to be <em>moved</em> (i.e. copied). On the other side, seeking in a <code>LinkedList</code> means following the links in <em>O(n)</em> (<em>n/2</em> steps) for worst case, whereas in an <code>ArrayList</code> the desired position can be computed mathematically and accessed in <em>O(1)</em>.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of using a <code>LinkedList</code> arise when you add or remove from the head of the list, since those operations are <em>O(1)</em>, while they are <em>O(n)</em> for <code>ArrayList</code>. Note that <code>ArrayDeque</code> may be a good alternative to <code>LinkedList</code> for adding and removing from the head, but it is not a <code>List</code>.</p>\n<p>Also, if you have large lists, keep in mind that memory usage is also different. Each element of a <code>LinkedList</code> has more overhead since pointers to the next and previous elements are also stored. <code>ArrayLists</code> don't have this overhead. However, <code>ArrayLists</code> take up as much memory as is allocated for the capacity, regardless of whether elements have actually been added.</p>\n<p>The default initial capacity of an <code>ArrayList</code> is pretty small (10 from Java 1.4 - 1.8). But since the underlying implementation is an array, the array must be resized if you add a lot of elements. To avoid the high cost of resizing when you know you're going to add a lot of elements, construct the <code>ArrayList</code> with a higher initial capacity.</p>\n<p>If the data structures perspective is used to understand the two structures, a LinkedList is basically a sequential data structure which contains a head Node. The Node is a wrapper for two components : a value of type T [accepted through generics] and another reference to the Node linked to it. So, we can assert it is a recursive data structure (a Node contains another Node which has another Node and so on...). Addition of elements takes linear time in LinkedList as stated above.</p>\n<p>An ArrayList, is a growable array. It is just like a regular array. Under the hood, when an element is added at index i, it creates another array with a size which is 1 greater than previous size (So in general, when n elements are to be added to an ArrayList, a new array of size previous size plus n is created). The elements are then copied from previous array to new one and the elements that are to be added are also placed at the specified indices.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":140398,"user_id":4725,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/B53xA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tom Hawtin - tackline","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4725/tom-hawtin-tackline"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":264,"last_activity_date":1613831177,"last_edit_date":1613831177,"creation_date":1227795616,"answer_id":323889,"question_id":322715,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"<p><code>ArrayList</code> is what you want. <code>LinkedList</code> is almost always a (performance) bug.</p>\n<p>Why <code>LinkedList</code> sucks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It uses lots of small memory objects, and therefore impacts performance across the process.</li>\n<li>Lots of small objects are bad for cache-locality.</li>\n<li>Any indexed operation requires a traversal, i.e. has O(n) performance.

I guess the mentioned CircularArrayList is similar to ArrayDeque in keeping a pointer to the head instead of shifting elements."},{"owner":{"reputation":18327,"user_id":1216775,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gX53v.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"akhil_mittal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1216775/akhil-mittal"},"edited":false,"score":6,"creation_date":1434555887,"post_id":882151,"comment_id":49831707,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<code>ArrayDeque</code> is likely to be faster than <code>Stack</code> when used as a stack, and faster than <code>LinkedList</code> when used as a queue."},{"owner":{"reputation":108964,"user_id":1441122,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XM5u8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stuart Marks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1441122/stuart-marks"},"edited":false,"score":5,"creation_date":1448750875,"post_id":882151,"comment_id":55711038,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"Note that akhil_mittal&#39;s comment is a quote from the <code>ArrayDeque</code> documentation."}],"owner":{"reputation":21509,"user_id":107331,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf6d0868b2b4c69bac3e6f265a32b6a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Daniel Martin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/107331/daniel-martin"},"comment_count":6,"is_accepted":false,"score":113,"last_activity_date":1242732080,"creation_date":1242732080,"answer_id":882151,"question_id":322715,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 2.5","body":"<p>Yeah, I know, this is an ancient question, but I'll throw in my two cents:</p>\n\n<p>LinkedList is <em>almost always</em> the wrong choice, performance-wise.

However, if your goal is performance, instead of LinkedList you should also consider using an ArrayBlockingQueue (if you can determine an upper bound on your queue size ahead of time, and can afford to allocate all the memory up front), or this <a href=\"http://www.javaspecialists.eu/archive/Issue027.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">CircularArrayList implementation</a>.

However, the reason behind the linear processing time comes from two very different reasons:</p>\n<p>In an ArrayList, you get to the element in O(1), but actually removing or inserting something makes it O(n) because all the following elements need to be changed.</p>\n<p>In a LinkedList, it takes O(n) to actually get to the desired element, because we have to start at the very beginning until we reach the desired index. Actually removing or inserting is constant, because we only have to change 1 reference for <code>remove()</code> and 2 references for <code>insert()</code>.</p>\n<p>Which of the two is faster for inserting and removing depends on where it happens. If we are closer to the beginning the LinkedList will be faster, because we have to go through relatively few elements. If we are closer to the end an ArrayList will be faster, because we get there in constant time and only have to change the few remaining elements that follow it. When done precisely in the middle the LinkedList will be faster because going through n elements is quicker than moving n values.</p>\n<p>Bonus: While there is no way of making these two methods O(1) for an ArrayList, there actually is a way to do this in LinkedLists. Let's say we want to go through the entire List removing and inserting elements on our way. Usually, you would start from the very beginning for each element using the LinkedList, we could also &quot;save&quot; the current element we're working on with an Iterator.

On the other side <code>LinkedList</code> implements doubly linked list which requires the traversal through all the elements for searching an element.</p>\n\n<p>2) <code>Deletion:</code> <code>LinkedList</code> remove operation gives <code>O(1)</code> performance while <code>ArrayList</code> gives variable performance: <code>O(n)</code> in worst case (while removing first element) and <code>O(1)</code> in best case (While removing last element).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Conclusion: LinkedList element deletion is faster compared to\n  ArrayList.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Reason: LinkedList’s each element maintains two pointers (addresses) which points to the both neighbor elements in the list.

While In ArrayList all the elements need to be shifted to fill out the space created by removed element.</p>\n\n<p>3) <code>Inserts Performance:</code> <code>LinkedList</code> add method gives <code>O(1)</code> performance while <code>ArrayList</code> gives <code>O(n)</code> in worst case.

It's a far more complex code, but it could help others that are restricted like I was.</p>\n<p>The first thing to do is to receive the input, in this case, a string of digits; I'll call it <code>String number</code>, and in this case, I'll exemplify it using the number 12, therefore <code>String number = &quot;12&quot;;</code></p>\n<p>Another limitation was the fact that I couldn't use repetitive cycles, therefore, a <code>for</code> cycle (which would have been perfect) can't be used either. This limits us a bit, but then again, that's the goal. Since I only needed two digits (taking the last two digits), a simple <code>charAt</code>solved it:</p>\n<pre><code> // Obtaining the integer values of the char 1 and 2 in ASCII\n int semilastdigitASCII = number.charAt(number.length() - 2);\n int lastdigitASCII = number.charAt(number.length() - 1);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Having the codes, we just need to look up at the table, and make the necessary adjustments:</p>\n<pre><code> double semilastdigit = semilastdigitASCII - 48;  // A quick look, and -48 is the key\n double lastdigit = lastdigitASCII - 48;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, why double? Well, because of a really &quot;weird&quot; step. Currently we have two doubles, 1 and 2, but we need to turn it into 12, there isn't any mathematic operation that we can do.</p>\n<p>We're dividing the latter (lastdigit) by 10 in the fashion <code>2/10 = 0.2</code> (hence why double) like this:</p>\n<pre><code> lastdigit = lastdigit / 10;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is merely playing with numbers. We were turning the last digit into a decimal. But now, look at what happens:</p>\n<pre><code> double jointdigits = semilastdigit + lastdigit; // 1.0 + 0.2 = 1.2\n</code></pre>\n<p>Without getting too into the math, we're simply isolating units the digits of a number. You see, since we only consider 0-9, dividing by a multiple of 10 is like creating a &quot;box&quot; where you store it (think back at when your first grade teacher explained you what a unit and a hundred were). So:</p>\n<pre><code> int finalnumber = (int) (jointdigits*10); // Be sure to use parentheses &quot;()&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And there you go. You turned a String of digits (in this case, two digits), into an integer composed of those two digits, considering the following limitations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No repetitive cycles</li>\n<li>No &quot;Magic&quot; Expressions such as parseInt</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3248,"user_id":3948862,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pXuEe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"D&#225;vid Horv&#225;th","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3948862/d%c3%a1vid-horv%c3%a1th"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1542102802,"post_id":23833311,"comment_id":93438432,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"You can do it simpler: <code>(int) Double.parseDouble(input.replaceAll(&quot;[^0-9\\\\.\\\\-]&quot;, &quot;&quot;));</code>"}],"owner":{"reputation":912,"user_id":2172026,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TXyda.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"fitorec","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2172026/fitorec"},"comment_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":19,"last_activity_date":1417250211,"last_edit_date":1417250211,"creation_date":1400859481,"answer_id":23833311,"question_id":5585779,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>I'm have a solution, but I do not know how effective it is.

Also, you can clearly distinguish the case where <code>-1</code> is parsed as a valid value and the case where an invalid String could not be parsed.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2001,"user_id":1551685,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4db3932926e0d73a94e94db75649454a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Steve Smith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1551685/steve-smith"},"edited":false,"score":5,"creation_date":1497438923,"post_id":36740121,"comment_id":76076808,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"This is exactly the same as the select answer."},{"owner":{"reputation":67931,"user_id":1081110,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fp4Pm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dawood ibn Kareem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1081110/dawood-ibn-kareem"},"edited":false,"score":6,"creation_date":1509301714,"post_id":36740121,"comment_id":80953908,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"There is no value to the site, in repeating an answer that someone else posted FIVE YEARS before you."},{"owner":{"reputation":27722,"user_id":63550,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RIZKi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Mortensen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/63550/peter-mortensen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1567465721,"post_id":36740121,"comment_id":101962561,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"This is already covered in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5585779/how-do-i-convert-a-string-to-an-int-in-java/5585800#5585800\">the accepted answer</a> (posted about 5 years prior)."}],"owner":{"reputation":599,"user_id":3641329,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca48c94892e78dcfa80f9cfee4ce4f45?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"iKing","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3641329/iking"},"comment_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1598024974,"last_edit_date":1598024974,"creation_date":1461146079,"answer_id":36740121,"question_id":5585779,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"<pre><code>int foo = Integer.parseInt(&quot;1234&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Make sure there is no non-numeric data in the string.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":32609,"user_id":2648077,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd10f51a1b9acf80448616c0a03cd261?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alireza Fattahi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2648077/alireza-fattahi"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":10,"last_activity_date":1567465681,"last_edit_date":1567465681,"creation_date":1469510787,"answer_id":38581630,"question_id":5585779,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"<p>As mentioned, Apache Commons' <code>NumberUtils</code> can do it.

Note that this only deals with base 10 numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The test code for the int parser is below the code below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>/*\n * Copyright 2019 Khang Hoang Nguyen\n * Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions\n * The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n * THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Therefore, to guarantee a consistent <code>serialVersionUID</code> value across different java compiler implementations, a serializable class must declare an explicit <code>serialVersionUID</code> value.

Its value is stored with the data when serializing. When de-serializing, the same version is checked to see how the serialized data matches the current code. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to version your data, you normally start with a <code>serialVersionUID</code> of 0, and bump it with every structural change to your class which alters the serialized data (adding or removing non-transient fields). </p>\n\n<p>The built-in de-serialization mechanism (<code>in.defaultReadObject()</code>) will refuse to de-serialize from old versions of the data. But if you want to you can define your own <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/serialization/spec/input.html#2971\" rel=\"noreferrer\">readObject()</a>-function which can read back old data. This custom code can then check the <code>serialVersionUID</code> in order to know which version the data is in and decide how to de-serialize it. This versioning technique is useful if you store serialized data which survives several versions of your code.</p>\n\n<p>But storing serialized data for such a long time span is not very common. It is far more common to use the serialization mechanism to temporarily write data to for instance a cache or send it over the network to another program with the same version of the relevant parts of the codebase. </p>\n\n<p>In this case you are not interested in maintaining backwards compatibility. You are only concerned with making sure that the code bases which are communicating indeed have the same versions of relevant classes. In order to facilitate such a check, you must maintain the <code>serialVersionUID</code> just like before and not forget to update it when making changes to your classes. </p>\n\n<p>If you do forget to update the field, you might end up with two different versions of a class with different structure but with the same <code>serialVersionUID</code>. If this happens, the default mechanism (<code>in.defaultReadObject()</code>) will not detect any difference, and try to de-serialize incompatible data. Now you might end up with a cryptic runtime error or silent failure (null fields). These types of errors might be hard to find.</p>\n\n<p>So to help this usecase, the Java platform offers you a choice of not setting the <code>serialVersionUID</code> manually. Instead, a hash of the class structure will be generated at compile-time and used as id. This mechanism will make sure that you never have different class structures with the same id, and so you will not get these hard-to-trace runtime serialization failures mentioned above.</p>\n\n<p>But there is a backside to the auto-generated id strategy. Namely that the generated ids for the same class might differ between compilers (as mentioned by Jon Skeet above). So if you communicate serialized data between code compiled with different compilers, it is recommended to maintain the ids manually anyway. </p>\n\n<p>And if you are backwards-compatible with your data like in the first use case mentioned, you also probably want to maintain the id yourself. This in order to get readable ids and have greater control over when and how they change.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":241,"user_id":2165875,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a79a1cb0c9611fb8b1e92ac4750285ae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mukti","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2165875/mukti"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":14,"last_activity_date":1363186476,"last_edit_date":1363186476,"creation_date":1363184813,"answer_id":15388086,"question_id":285793,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>Field data represents some information stored in the class.\nClass implements the <code>Serializable</code> interface, \nso eclipse automatically offered  to declare the <code>serialVersionUID</code> field.

Well I have found one.</p>\n\n<p>Say you create a <code>Car</code> class, instantiate it, and write it out to an object stream. The flattened car object sits in the file system for some time. Meanwhile, if the <code>Car</code> class is modified by adding a new field. Later on, when you try to read (i.e. deserialize) the flattened <code>Car</code> object, you get the <code>java.io.InvalidClassException</code> – because all serializable classes are automatically given a unique identifier. This exception is thrown when the identifier of the class is not equal to the identifier of the flattened object. If you really think about it, the exception is thrown because of the addition of the new field. You can avoid this exception being thrown by controlling the versioning yourself by declaring an explicit serialVersionUID. There is also a small performance benefit in explicitly declaring your <code>serialVersionUID</code> (because does not have to be calculated). So, it is best practice to add your own serialVersionUID to your Serializable classes as soon as you create them as shown below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Car {\n    static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; //assign a long value\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":3097,"user_id":1264138,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sR3pc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Henrique Ordine","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1264138/henrique-ordine"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":20,"last_activity_date":1387476918,"last_edit_date":1387476918,"creation_date":1369078357,"answer_id":16656980,"question_id":285793,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>As for an example where the missing serialVersionUID might cause a problem:</p>\n\n<p>I'm working on this Java EE application that is composed of a Web module that uses an <code>EJB</code> module.

If both are equal then only it proceeds with the further process of deserialization else throws InvalidClassException.</p>\n\n<p>So we conclude that to make Serialization/Deserialization process successful the serialVersionUID of serialized object must be equivalent to the serialVersionUID of the class. In case if programmer specifies the serialVersionUID value explicitly in the program then the same value will be associated with the serialized object and the class, irrespective of the serialization and deserialzation platform(for ex. serialization might be done on platform like windows by using sun or MS JVM and Deserialization might be on different platform Linux using Zing JVM).</p>\n\n<p>But in case if serialVersionUID is not specified by programmer then while doing Serialization\\DeSerialization  of any object, Java runtime uses its own algorithm to calculate it. This serialVersionUID calculation algorithm varies from one JRE to another. It is also possible that the environment where the object is serialized is using one JRE (ex: SUN JVM) and the environment where deserialzation happens is using Linux Jvm(zing). In such cases serialVersionUID associated with serialized object will be different than the serialVersionUID of class calculated at deserialzation environment. In turn deserialization will not be successful.

Extract an interface from the helper class, add a public getter and setter to the original class to inject the helper class (used through its interface), and then inject a mock version of the helper class into the original class to test how the original class responds to exceptions from the helper.

In my opinion it&#39;s the best answer to the question. By testing private methods you are testing the implementation. This defeats the purpose of unit testing, which is to test the inputs/outputs of a class&#39; contract. A test should <i>only</i> know enough about the implementation to mock the methods it calls on its dependencies. Nothing more. If you can not change your implementation without having to change a test - chances are that your test strategy is poor."},{"owner":{"reputation":143,"user_id":3167155,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd4705e916f325c8ec2c40955e9bc424?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Aaron Marcus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3167155/aaron-marcus"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11782,"user_id":683077,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f9374eb11453c92578511c19deb2a34f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Colin M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/683077/colin-m"},"edited":false,"score":11,"creation_date":1427991708,"post_id":1043013,"comment_id":47007579,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"@Colin M That&#39;s not really what he&#39;s asking though ;) Let him decide it, you don&#39;t know the project."},{"owner":{"reputation":7916,"user_id":912829,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8155348e86202fd2f553332dde3b2fcf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ACV","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/912829/acv"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1512041567,"post_id":1043013,"comment_id":82101788,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"Not really true.

When you have to start thinking about using reflection or other kind of stuff, for just testing your code, something is going wrong with your code.</p>\n\n<p>You mentioned different types of problems. Let's start with private fields. In case of private fields I would have added a new constructor and injected fields into that. Instead of this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ClassToTest {\n\n    private final String first = \"first\";\n    private final List&lt;String&gt; second = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'd have used this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ClassToTest {\n\n    private final String first;\n    private final List&lt;String&gt; second;\n\n    public ClassToTest() {\n        this(\"first\", new ArrayList&lt;&gt;());\n    }\n\n    public ClassToTest(final String first, final List&lt;String&gt; second) {\n        this.first = first;\n        this.second = second;\n    }\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This won't be a problem even with some legacy code. Old code will be using an empty constructor, and if you ask me, refactored code will look cleaner, and you'll be able to inject necessary values in test without reflection.</p>\n\n<p>Now about private methods. In my personal experience when you have to stub a private method for testing, then that method has nothing to do in that class. A common pattern, in that case, would be to <em>wrap</em> it within an interface, like <code>Callable</code> and then you pass in that interface also in the constructor (with that multiple constructor trick):</p>\n\n<pre><code>public ClassToTest() {\n    this(...);\n}\n\npublic ClassToTest(final Callable&lt;T&gt; privateMethodLogic) {\n    this.privateMethodLogic = privateMethodLogic;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Mostly all that I wrote looks like it's a dependency injection pattern. In my personal experience it's really useful while testing, and I think that this kind of code is cleaner and will be easier to maintain. I'd say the same about nested classes. If a nested class contains heavy logic it would be better if you'd moved it as a package private class and have injected it into a class needing it.</p>\n\n<p>There are also several other design patterns which I have used while refactoring and maintaining legacy code, but it all depends on cases of your code to test. Using reflection mostly is not a problem, but when you have an enterprise application which is heavily tested and tests are run before every deployment everything gets really slow (it's just annoying and I don't like that kind of stuff).</p>\n\n<p>There is also setter injection, but I wouldn't recommended using it. I'd better stick with a constructor and initialize everything when it's really necessary, leaving the possibility for injecting necessary dependencies.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":190,"user_id":7599315,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c0365d97605028731a4cd879a6cab525?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Rahul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7599315/rahul"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1504892218,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1504892585,"last_edit_date":1504892585,"creation_date":1504892218,"answer_id":46121866,"question_id":34571,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>You can use PowerMockito to set return values for private fields and private methods that are called/used in the private method you want to test:</p>\n\n<p>Eg.

Those of you contributing answers that direct the author of the question towards a 'work around' are doing a massive disservice to the community. Testing is a major part of all engineering disciplines, you would not want to buy a car that is not properly tested, and tested in a meaningful way, so why would anyone want to buy or use software that is tested poorly? The reason people do this anyways is probably because the effects of badly tested software are felt way after the fact, and we don't usually associate them with bodily harm. This is a very dangerous perception which will be difficult to change, but it is our responsibility to deliver safe products regardless of what even management is bullying us to do. Think Equifax hack... </p>\n\n<p>We must strive to build an environment that encourages good software engineering practices, this does not mean ostracizing the weak/lazy among us who do not take their craft seriously, but rather, to create a status quo of accountability and self reflection that would encourage everyone to pursue growth, both mentally and skillfully.

So, when you have control over production code as well as tests, delete that <code>private</code> access modifier may be the best option for you because relatively it does not cause huge impact. And, that makes testing as well as <strong>private method spying</strong> possible.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Autowired\nprivate SomeService service; // with a package private method \"doSomething()\"\n\n@Test\nvoid shouldReturnTrueDoSomething() {\n    assertThat(doSomething(input), is(true)); // package private method testing\n}\n\n@Test\nvoid shouldReturnTrueWhenServiceThrowsException() {\n    SomeService spy = Mockito.spy(service); // spying real object\n    doThrow(new AppException()).when(spy).doSomething(input); // spy package private method\n    ...\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When it comes to internal fields, in Spring you have <code>ReflectionUtils.setField()</code>. </p>\n\n<p>At last, sometimes we can bypass the problem itself: if there is a coverage requirement to meet, maybe you can move these private methods into an inner static class and ignore this class in Jacoco. I just found some way to ignore inner class in Jacoco gradle tasks. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58604955/how-to-ignore-inner-static-classes-in-jacoco-when-using-gradle\">another question</a></p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":11921,"user_id":4770877,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cccebea2d190bf8f2054c1949ffa8677?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"yoAlex5","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4770877/yoalex5"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"community_owned_date":1562946652,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1562946652,"creation_date":1562946652,"answer_id":57010282,"question_id":34571,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"<p>Android has <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations.html#visible\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>@VisibleForTesting</code></a> annotation from <code>android.support.annotation</code> package.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The <code>@VisibleForTesting</code> annotation indicates that an annotated method is more visible than normally necessary to make the method testable.

But you didn't use any line break in second loop. So you are going to print a word with 1000 characters in the second loop. That causes a word-wrapping problem. If we use a non-word character \" \" after B, it takes only <strong><em>5.35 seconds</em></strong> to compile the program. And If we use a line break in the second loop after passing 100 values or 50 values, it takes only <strong><em>8.56 seconds</em></strong> and <strong><em>7.05 seconds</em></strong> respectively. </p>\n\n<pre><code>Random r = new Random();\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {\n    for (int j = 0; j &lt; 1000; j++) {\n        if(r.nextInt(4) == 0) {\n            System.out.print(\"O\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.print(\"B\");\n        }\n        if(j%100==0){               //Adding a line break in second loop      \n            System.out.println();\n        }                    \n    }\n    System.out.println(\"\");                \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Another advice is that to change settings of NetBeans IDE.

I generated 2 jars and a directory with all the jars. I compared the results and definitely the maven-shade-plugin is the best. My challenge was that I have multiple spring resources that needed to be merged, as well as jax-rs, and JDBC services. They were all merged properly by the shade plugin in comparison with the maven-assembly-plugin. In which case the spring will fail unless you copy them to your own resources folder and merge them manually one time. Both plugins output the correct dependency tree. I had multiple scopes like test,provide, compile, etc the test and provided were skipped by both plugins. They both produced the same manifest but I was able to consolidate licenses with the shade plugin using their transformer.\nWith the maven-dependency-plugin of course you don't have those problems because the jars are not extracted.

It is not advisable to use AsyncTask for networking unless you <em>really</em> know what you are doing.

This reference prevents the Activity from being garbage collected until the AsyncTask's background work completes. If the user's connection is slow, and/or the download is large, these short-term memory leaks can become a problem - for example, if the orientation changes several times (and you don't cancel the executing tasks), or the user navigates away from the Activity.</li>\n<li>AsyncTask has different execution characteristics depending on the platform it executes on: prior to API level 4 AsyncTasks execute serially on a single background thread; from API level 4 through API level 10, AsyncTasks execute on a pool of up to 128 threads; from API level 11 onwards AsyncTask executes serially on a single background thread (unless you use the overloaded <code>executeOnExecutor</code> method and supply an alternative executor). Code that works fine when running serially on ICS may break when executed concurrently on Gingerbread, say if you have inadvertent order-of-execution dependencies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you want to avoid short-term memory leaks, have well-defined execution characteristics across all platforms, and have a base to build really robust network handling, you might want to consider:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Using a library that does a nice job of this for you - there's a nice comparison of networking libs in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16902716/comparison-of-android-networking-libraries-okhttp-retrofit-volley\">this question</a>, or</li>\n<li>Using a <code>Service</code> or <code>IntentService</code> instead, perhaps with a <code>PendingIntent</code> to return the result via the Activity's <code>onActivityResult</code> method.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2><em>IntentService approach</em></h2>\n\n<p>Down-sides:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>More code and complexity than <code>AsyncTask</code>, though not as much as you might think</li>\n<li>Will queue requests and run them on a <em>single</em> background thread. You can easily control this by replacing <code>IntentService</code> with an equivalent <code>Service</code> implementation, perhaps like <a href=\"https://github.com/steveliles/AsyncAndroid/blob/master/AsyncAndroid/src/main/java/com/packt/asyncandroid/chapter6/ConcurrentIntentService.java\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this one</a>.</li>\n<li>Um, I can't think of any others right now actually</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Up-sides:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Avoids the short-term memory leak problem</li>\n<li>If your activity restarts while network operations are in-flight it can still receive the result of the download via its <code>onActivityResult</code> method</li>\n<li>Better platform than AsyncTask to build and re-use robust networking code. Example: if you need to do an important upload, you could do it from <code>AsyncTask</code> in an <code>Activity</code>, but if the user context-switches out of the app to take a phone call, the system <em>may</em> kill the app before the upload completes. It is <em>less likely</em> to kill an application with an active <code>Service</code>.</li>\n<li>If you use your own concurrent version of <code>IntentService</code> (like the one I linked above) you can control the level of concurrency via the <code>Executor</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><em>Implementation summary</em></h2>\n\n<p>You can implement an <code>IntentService</code> to perform downloads on a single background thread quite easily.</p>\n\n<p>Step 1: Create an <code>IntentService</code> to perform the download. You can tell it what to download via <code>Intent</code> extra's, and pass it a <code>PendingIntent</code> to use to return the result to the <code>Activity</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import android.app.IntentService;\nimport android.app.PendingIntent;\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport android.util.Log;\n\nimport java.io.InputStream;\nimport java.net.MalformedURLException;\nimport java.net.URL;\n\npublic class DownloadIntentService extends IntentService {\n\n    private static final String TAG = DownloadIntentService.class.getSimpleName();\n\n    public static final String PENDING_RESULT_EXTRA = \"pending_result\";\n    public static final String URL_EXTRA = \"url\";\n    public static final String RSS_RESULT_EXTRA = \"url\";\n\n    public static final int RESULT_CODE = 0;\n    public static final int INVALID_URL_CODE = 1;\n    public static final int ERROR_CODE = 2;\n\n    private IllustrativeRSSParser parser;\n\n    public DownloadIntentService() {\n        super(TAG);\n\n        // make one and re-use, in the case where more than one intent is queued\n        parser = new IllustrativeRSSParser();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onHandleIntent(Intent intent) {\n        PendingIntent reply = intent.getParcelableExtra(PENDING_RESULT_EXTRA);\n        InputStream in = null;\n        try {\n            try {\n                URL url = new URL(intent.getStringExtra(URL_EXTRA));\n                IllustrativeRSS rss = parser.parse(in = url.openStream());\n\n                Intent result = new Intent();\n                result.putExtra(RSS_RESULT_EXTRA, rss);\n\n                reply.send(this, RESULT_CODE, result);\n            } catch (MalformedURLException exc) {\n                reply.send(INVALID_URL_CODE);\n            } catch (Exception exc) {\n                // could do better by treating the different sax/xml exceptions individually\n                reply.send(ERROR_CODE);\n            }\n        } catch (PendingIntent.CanceledException exc) {\n            Log.i(TAG, \"reply cancelled\", exc);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Step 2: Register the service in the manifest:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;service\n        android:name=\".DownloadIntentService\"\n        android:exported=\"false\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Step 3: Invoke the service from the Activity, passing a PendingResult object which the Service will use to return the result:</p>\n\n<pre><code>PendingIntent pendingResult = createPendingResult(\n    RSS_DOWNLOAD_REQUEST_CODE, new Intent(), 0);\nIntent intent = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), DownloadIntentService.class);\nintent.putExtra(DownloadIntentService.URL_EXTRA, URL);\nintent.putExtra(DownloadIntentService.PENDING_RESULT_EXTRA, pendingResult);\nstartService(intent);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Step 4: Handle the result in onActivityResult:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Override\nprotected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n    if (requestCode == RSS_DOWNLOAD_REQUEST_CODE) {\n        switch (resultCode) {\n            case DownloadIntentService.INVALID_URL_CODE:\n                handleInvalidURL();\n                break;\n            case DownloadIntentService.ERROR_CODE:\n                handleError(data);\n                break;\n            case DownloadIntentService.RESULT_CODE:\n                handleRSS(data);\n                break;\n        }\n        handleRSS(data);\n    }\n    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A Github project containing a complete working Android-Studio/Gradle project is available <a href=\"https://github.com/steveliles/Android-Download-Service-Example\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":848,"user_id":1837505,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vXYYa.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"perry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1837505/perry"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":32,"last_activity_date":1466629774,"last_edit_date":1466629774,"creation_date":1393309431,"answer_id":22006259,"question_id":6343166,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>This is only thrown for applications targeting the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history#Android_3.0_Honeycomb_.28API_level_11.29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Honeycomb</a> SDK or higher.

Also throw in a try or catch block won&#39;t hinder the finally block from execution, so ofc. one might expect that when you throw in a finally block it still executes."},{"owner":{"reputation":1822,"user_id":369604,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/613ba412b35c0d51e4de306d92858bd4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Loduwijk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/369604/loduwijk"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1515025473,"post_id":36926373,"comment_id":83149043,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"&quot;how is return different from throw?&quot; In a few ways, none of which are relevant here.

This is a relatively advanced feature and should be used only by developers who have a strong grasp of the fundamentals of the language. With that caveat in mind, reflection is a powerful technique and can enable applications to perform operations which would otherwise be impossible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Extensibility Features</strong></p>\n\n<p>An application may make use of external, user-defined classes by creating instances of extensibility objects using their fully-qualified names.\nClass Browsers and Visual Development Environments\nA class browser needs to be able to enumerate the members of classes. Visual development environments can benefit from making use of type information available in reflection to aid the developer in writing correct code.\nDebuggers and Test Tools\nDebuggers need to be able to examine private members in classes. Test harnesses can make use of reflection to systematically call a discoverable set APIs defined on a class, to ensure a high level of code coverage in a test suite.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Drawbacks of Reflection</strong></p>\n\n<p>Reflection is powerful, but should not be used indiscriminately. If it is possible to perform an operation without using reflection, then it is preferable to avoid using it. The following concerns should be kept in mind when accessing code via reflection.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Performance Overhead</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Because reflection involves types that are dynamically resolved, certain Java virtual machine optimizations cannot be performed. Consequently, reflective operations have slower performance than their non-reflective counterparts and should be avoided in sections of code which are called frequently in performance-sensitive applications.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Security Restrictions</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Reflection requires a runtime permission which may not be present when running under a security manager. This is in an important consideration for code which has to run in a restricted security context, such as in an Applet.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exposure of Internals</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since reflection allows code to perform operations that would be illegal in non-reflective code, such as accessing private fields and methods, the use of reflection can result in unexpected side-effects, which may render code dysfunctional and may destroy portability. Reflective code breaks abstractions and therefore may change behavior with upgrades of the platform.</p>\n\n<p>source: <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Reflection API</a></p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":258,"user_id":4216954,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QmvhwgPeY5c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAPc/7ysOFb0U7Gs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Isuru Jayakantha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4216954/isuru-jayakantha"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":19,"last_activity_date":1565794585,"last_edit_date":1565794585,"creation_date":1415248951,"answer_id":26771874,"question_id":37628,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"<p>Simple example for reflection.\nIn a chess game, you do not know what will be moved by the user at run time. reflection can be used to call methods which are already implemented at run time:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Test {\n\n    public void firstMoveChoice(){\n        System.out.println(\"First Move\");\n    } \n    public void secondMOveChoice(){\n        System.out.println(\"Second Move\");\n    }\n    public void thirdMoveChoice(){\n        System.out.println(\"Third Move\");\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IllegalAccessException, IllegalArgumentException, InvocationTargetException { \n        Test test = new Test();\n        Method[] method = test.getClass().getMethods();\n        //firstMoveChoice\n        method[0].invoke(test, null);\n        //secondMoveChoice\n        method[1].invoke(test, null);\n        //thirdMoveChoice\n        method[2].invoke(test, null);\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":960,"user_id":1092670,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sZiEO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"AnthonyJClink","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1092670/anthonyjclink"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1517328862,"post_id":34149864,"comment_id":84046714,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"type(), isinstance(), callable(), dir() and getattr().   .... these are pythonic reflection calls"}],"owner":{"reputation":4995,"user_id":2288882,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fbefc3abe38dfc80b207905af1794924?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Marcus Thornton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2288882/marcus-thornton"},"comment_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":11,"last_activity_date":1532452936,"last_edit_date":1532452936,"creation_date":1449558139,"answer_id":34149864,"question_id":37628,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 4.0","body":"<p>Reflection is to let object to see their appearance.

What this means is that you can annotate your component classes with @Component, but by annotating them with @Repository, @Service, or @Controller instead, your classes are more properly suited for processing by tools or associating with aspects. For example, these stereotype annotations make ideal targets for pointcuts. Of course, it is also possible that @Repository, @Service, and @Controller may carry additional semantics in future releases of the Spring Framework. Thus, if you are making a decision between using @Component or @Service for your service layer, @Service is clearly the better choice.

SERVICES should be used judiciously and not\n  allowed to strip the ENTITIES and VALUE OBJECTS of all their behavior.\n  But when an operation is actually an important domain concept, a\n  SERVICE forms a natural part of a MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN.

It's not that the rest of the answers are wrong, it's just that they aren't right. And, to stop the hordes of trolls, yes, I know that technically these annotations are effectively the same thing and most interchangeable even unto spring 5. Now, for the right answer:</p>\n<p>These three annotations are completely different things and are not interchangeable. You can tell that because there are three of them rather than just one. They are not intended to be interchangeable, they're just implemented that way out of elegance and convenience.</p>\n<p>Modern programming is invention, art, technique, and communication, in varying proportions. The communication bit is usually very important because code is usually read much more often than its written. As a programmer you're not only trying to solve the technical problem, you're also trying to communicate your intent to future programmers who read your code. These programmers may not share your native language, nor your social environment, and it is possible that they may be reading your code 50-years in the future (it's not as unlikely as you may think). It's difficult to communicate effectively that far into the future. Therefore, it is vital that we use the clearest, most efficient, correct, and communicative language available to us. That we chose our words carefully to have maximum impact and to be as clear as possible as to our intent.</p>\n<p>For example, it is vital that <code>@Repository</code> is used when we're writing a repository, rather than <code>@Component</code>. The latter is a very poor choice of annotation for a repository because it does not indicate that we're looking at a repository. We can assume that a repository is also a spring-bean, but not that a component is a repository. With <code>@Repository</code> we are being clear and specific in our language. We are stating clearly that this is a repository. With <code>@Component</code> we are leaving it to the reader to decide what type of component they are reading, and they will have to read the whole class (and possibly a tree of subclasses and interfaces) to infer meaning. The class could then possibly be misinterpreted by a reader in the distant future as not being a repository, and we would have been partially responsible for this mistake because we, who knew full well that this is a repository, failed to be specific in our language and communicate effectively our intent.</p>\n<p>I won't go into the other examples, but will state as clearly as I can: these annotations are completely different things and should be used appropriately, as per their intent. <code>@Repository</code> is for storage repositories and no other annotation is correct. <code>@Service</code> is for services and no other annotation is correct. <code>@Component</code> is for components that are neither repositories nor services, and to use either of these in its place would also be incorrect. It might compile, it might even run and pass your tests, but it would be wrong and I would think less of you (professionally) if you were to do this.</p>\n<p>There are examples of this throughout spring (and programming in general). You must not use <code>@Controller</code> when writing a REST API, because <code>@RestController</code> is available. You must not use <code>@RequestMapping</code> when <code>@GetMapping</code> is a valid alternative. Etc. Etc. Etc. You <em>must</em> chose the most specific exact and correct language you can to communicate your intent to your readers, otherwise, you are introducing risks into your system, and risk has a cost.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"reputation":22387,"user_id":863084,"user_type":"unregistered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be273143043ed0ff5b55406ac70ff41e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Colin McCree","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/863084/colin-mccree"},"comment_count":3,"is_answered":true,"view_count":951113,"protected_date":1452629449,"answer_count":29,"score":2233,"last_activity_date":1612416936,"creation_date":1311671446,"last_edit_date":1581945021,"question_id":6827752,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6827752/whats-the-difference-between-component-repository-service-annotations-in","title":"What&#39;s the difference between @Component, @Repository &amp; @Service annotations in Spring?","body":"<p>Can <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Component.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>@Component</code></a>, <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Repository.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>@Repository</code></a> and <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Service.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>@Service</code></a> annotations be used interchangeably in Spring or do they provide any particular functionality besides acting as a notation device?</p>\n\n<p>In other words, if I have a Service class and I change the annotation from <code>@Service</code> to <code>@Component</code>, will it still behave the same way? </p>\n\n<p>Or does the annotation also influence the behavior and functionality of the class?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","multithreading","runnable","implements","java-threads"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":44716,"user_id":20774,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e32e31d4c24c1558abd6567f2ab60ba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"James McMahon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/20774/james-mcmahon"},"edited":false,"score":62,"creation_date":1241816188,"post_id":541487,"comment_id":650053,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 2.5","body":"Thanks for this question, the answers cleared up a lot of misconceptions I had.

The integration of timeouts, proper cancelling and the thread pooling of the modern concurrency support are all much more useful to me than piles of raw Threads.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Follow-up:</strong> there is a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/FutureTask.html#FutureTask-java.lang.Runnable-V-\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>FutureTask</code> constructor</a> that allows you to use Runnables (if that's what you are most comfortable with) and still get the benefit of the modern concurrency tools.  <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/FutureTask.html#FutureTask-java.lang.Runnable-V-\" rel=\"noreferrer\">To quote the javadoc</a>:</p>\n\n<p>If you don't need a particular result, consider using constructions of the form: </p>\n\n<pre><code>Future&lt;?&gt; f = new FutureTask&lt;Object&gt;(runnable, null)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, if we replace their <code>runnable</code> with your <code>threadA</code>, we get the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>new FutureTask&lt;Object&gt;(threadA, null)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Another option that allows you to stay closer to Runnables is a <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ThreadPoolExecutor</a>.

In this case you:</p>\n\n<p>A) might give it a more useful name for debugging purposes </p>\n\n<p>B) are forcing that that name be used for all instances of that class (unless you ignore the fact that it is a thread and do the above with it as if it is a Runnable but we are talking about convention here in any case so can ignore that possibility I feel).</p>\n\n<p>You might even for example take a stack trace of its creation and use that as the thread name.  This might seem odd but depending on how your code is structured it can be very useful for debugging purposes.</p>\n\n<p>This might seem like a small thing but where you have a very complex application with a lot of threads and all of a sudden things 'have stopped' (either for reasons of deadlock or possibly because of a flaw in a network protocol which would be less obvious - or other endless reasons) then getting a stack dump from Java where all the threads are called 'Thread-1','Thread-2','Thread-3' is not always very useful (it depends on how your threads are structured and whether you can usefully tell which is which just by their stack trace - not always possible if you are using groups of multiple threads all running the same code).</p>\n\n<p>Having said that you could of course also do the above in a generic way by creating an extension of the thread class which sets its name to a stack trace of its creation call and then use that with your Runnable implementations instead of the standard java Thread class (see below) but in addition to the stack trace there might be more context specific information that would be useful in the thread name for debugging (a reference to one of many queues or sockets it could processing for example in which case you might prefer to extend Thread specifically for that case so that you can have the compiler force you (or others using your libraries) to pass in certain info (e.g. the queue/socket in question) for use in the name).</p>\n\n<p>Here's an example of the generic thread with the calling stack trace as its name:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class DebuggableThread extends Thread {\n    private static String getStackTrace(String name) {\n        Throwable t= new Throwable(\"DebuggableThread-\"+name);\n        ByteArrayOutputStream os = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\n        PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(os);\n        t.printStackTrace(ps);\n        return os.toString();\n    }\n\n    public DebuggableThread(String name) {\n        super(getStackTrace(name));\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        System.out.println(new Thread());\n        System.out.println(new DebuggableThread(\"MainTest\"));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and here's a sample of the output comparing the two names:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Thread[Thread-1,5,main]\nThread[java.lang.Throwable: DebuggableThread-MainTest\n    at DebuggableThread.getStackTrace(DebuggableThread.java:6)\n    at DebuggableThread.&lt;init&gt;(DebuggableThread.java:14)\n    at DebuggableThread.main(DebuggableThread.java:19)\n,5,main]\n</code></pre>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":63,"user_id":1189632,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f927fcb9ea51faa4ad3074bb407bbf1f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"AHugoH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1189632/ahugoh"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1341587559,"creation_date":1341587559,"answer_id":11364937,"question_id":541487,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>This maybe isn't an answer but anyway; there is one more way to create threads:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Thread t = new Thread() {\n    public void run() {\n        // Code here\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":468,"user_id":1458183,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dba872f7ddc2b9f69a4165b39ff570cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"developer110","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1458183/developer110"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1345312031,"creation_date":1345312031,"answer_id":12020863,"question_id":541487,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p><code>Runnable</code> is an interface, while <code>Thread</code> is a class which implements this interface.

This will help to understand <code>Extending v/s Implementing Thread</code>.<br>Extends binds two class files very closely and can cause some pretty hard to deal with code.</p>\n<p>Both approaches do the same job but there have been some differences.<br>\n<em>The most common difference is</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you extend Thread class, after that you can’t extend any other class which you required. (As you know, Java does not allow inheriting more than one class).</li>\n<li>When you implement Runnable, you can save space for your class to extend any other class in the future or now.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>However, one <strong>significant difference</strong> between implementing Runnable and extending Thread is that<br></em> <code>by extending Thread, each of your threads has a unique object associated with it, whereas implementing Runnable, many threads can share the same object instance.</code></p>\n<p><strong>The following example will help you to understand more clearly</strong></p>\n<pre><code>//Implement Runnable Interface...\nclass ImplementsRunnable implements Runnable {\n\n    private int counter = 0;\n\n    public void run() {\n        counter++;\n        System.out.println(&quot;ImplementsRunnable : Counter : &quot; + counter);\n    }\n}\n\n//Extend Thread class...\nclass ExtendsThread extends Thread {\n\n    private int counter = 0;\n\n    public void run() {\n        counter++;\n        System.out.println(&quot;ExtendsThread : Counter : &quot; + counter);\n    }\n}\n    \n//Use the above classes here in main to understand the differences more clearly...\npublic class ThreadVsRunnable {\n\n    public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {\n        // Multiple threads share the same object.\n        ImplementsRunnable rc = new ImplementsRunnable();\n        Thread t1 = new Thread(rc);\n        t1.start();\n        Thread.sleep(1000); // Waiting for 1 second before starting next thread\n        Thread t2 = new Thread(rc);\n        t2.start();\n        Thread.sleep(1000); // Waiting for 1 second before starting next thread\n        Thread t3 = new Thread(rc);\n        t3.start();\n\n        // Creating new instance for every thread access.\n        ExtendsThread tc1 = new ExtendsThread();\n        tc1.start();\n        Thread.sleep(1000); // Waiting for 1 second before starting next thread\n        ExtendsThread tc2 = new ExtendsThread();\n        tc2.start();\n        Thread.sleep(1000); // Waiting for 1 second before starting next thread\n        ExtendsThread tc3 = new ExtendsThread();\n        tc3.start();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Output of the above program.</strong></p>\n<pre><code>ImplementsRunnable : Counter : 1\nImplementsRunnable : Counter : 2\nImplementsRunnable : Counter : 3\nExtendsThread : Counter : 1\nExtendsThread : Counter : 1\nExtendsThread : Counter : 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the Runnable interface approach, only one instance of a class is being created and it has been shared by different threads. So the value of counter is incremented for each and every thread access.</p>\n<p>Whereas, Thread class approach, you must have to create separate instance for every thread access. Hence different memory is allocated for every class instances and each has separate counter, the value remains same, which means no increment will happen because none of the object reference is same.</p>\n<p><strong>When to use Runnable?</strong><br>\nUse Runnable interface when you want to access the same resources from the group of threads. Avoid using Thread class here, because multiple objects creation consumes more memory and it becomes a big performance overhead.</p>\n<p>A class that implements Runnable is not a thread and just a class. For a Runnable to become a Thread, You need to create an instance of Thread and passing itself in as the target.</p>\n<p>In most cases, the Runnable interface should be used if you are only planning to override the <code>run()</code> method and no other Thread methods. This is important because classes should not be subclassed unless the programmer intends on modifying or enhancing the fundamental behavior of the class.</p>\n<p>When there is a need to extend a superclass, implementing the Runnable interface is more appropriate than using the Thread class. Because we can extend another class while implementing Runnable interface to make a thread.<br></p>\n<p>I hope this will help!</p>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":14014,"user_id":1769720,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5815db653a13a7122066f811caa020a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"didierc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1769720/didierc"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1368261699,"last_edit_date":1368261699,"creation_date":1363601671,"answer_id":15474258,"question_id":541487,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>That's the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle\" rel=\"noreferrer\">S</a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SOLID</a>: Single responsibility. </p>\n\n<p>A <em>thread</em> embodies the <strong>running context</strong> (as in execution context: stack frame, thread id, etc.) of the <em>asynchronous execution</em> of a piece of code.

It's easier to explain with code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void varargs(int fixed1, String fixed2, int... varargs) {...}\n...\nvarargs(0, \"\", 100); // fixed1 = 0, fixed2 = \"\", varargs = {100}\nvarargs(0, \"\", 100, 200); // fixed1 = 0, fixed2 = \"\", varargs = {100, 200};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Inside the method, <code>varargs</code> is treated as a normal <code>int[]</code>. <code>Type...</code> can only be used in method parameters, so <code>int... i = new int[] {}</code> will not compile.</p>\n\n<p>Note that when passing an <code>int[]</code> to a method (or any other <code>Type[]</code>), you cannot use the third way. In the statement <code>int[] i = *{a, b, c, d, etc}*</code>, the compiler assumes that the <code>{...}</code> means an <code>int[]</code>. But that is because you are declaring a variable. When passing an array to a method, the declaration must either be <code>new Type[capacity]</code> or <code>new Type[] {...}</code>.</p>\n\n<h1>Multidimensional Arrays</h1>\n\n<p>Multidimensional arrays are much harder to deal with. Essentially, a 2D array is an array of arrays. <code>int[][]</code> means an array of <code>int[]</code>s. The key is that if an <code>int[][]</code> is declared as <code>int[x][y]</code>, the maximum index is <code>i[x-1][y-1]</code>. Essentially, a rectangular <code>int[3][5]</code> is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[0, 0] [1, 0] [2, 0]\n[0, 1] [1, 1] [2, 1]\n[0, 2] [1, 2] [2, 2]\n[0, 3] [1, 3] [2, 3]\n[0, 4] [1, 4] [2, 4]\n</code></pre>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":3207,"user_id":2787184,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F69PI.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"2787184","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2787184/2787184"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":9,"last_activity_date":1466891985,"last_edit_date":1466891985,"creation_date":1444990730,"answer_id":33168030,"question_id":1200621,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>Declaring an array of object references:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Animal {}\n\nclass Horse extends Animal {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        /*\n         * Array of Animal can hold Animal and Horse (all subtypes of Animal allowed)\n         */\n        Animal[] a1 = new Animal[10];\n        a1[0] = new Animal();\n        a1[1] = new Horse();\n\n        /*\n         * Array of Animal can hold Animal and Horse and all subtype of Horse\n         */\n        Animal[] a2 = new Horse[10];\n        a2[0] = new Animal();\n        a2[1] = new Horse();\n\n        /*\n         * Array of Horse can hold only Horse and its subtype (if any) and not\n           allowed supertype of Horse nor other subtype of Animal.\n         */\n        Horse[] h1 = new Horse[10];\n        h1[0] = new Animal(); // Not allowed\n        h1[1] = new Horse();\n\n        /*\n         * This can not be declared.\n         */\n        Horse[] h2 = new Animal[10]; // Not allowed\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"owner":{"reputation":5498,"user_id":2128327,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdb32ecba89326d1528dbf8673e68b20?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Khaled.K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2128327/khaled-k"},"comment_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":8,"last_activity_date":1445435104,"last_edit_date":1445435104,"creation_date":1445434787,"answer_id":33260915,"question_id":1200621,"content_license":"CC BY-SA 3.0","body":"<p>Array is a sequential list of items</p>\n\n<pre><code>int item = value;\n\nint [] one_dimensional_array = { value, value, value, .., value };\n\nint [][] two_dimensional_array =\n{\n  { value, value, value, .. value },\n  { value, value, value, .. value },\n    ..     ..     ..        ..\n  { value, value, value, .. value }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If it's an object, then it's the same concept</p>\n\n<pre><code>Object item = new Object();\n\nObject [] one_dimensional_array = { new Object(), new Object(), .. new Object() };\n\nObject [][] two_dimensional_array =\n{\n  { new Object(), new Object(), .. new Object() },\n  { new Object(), new Object(), .. new Object() },\n    ..            ..               ..\n  { new Object(), new Object(), .. new Object() }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In case of objects, you need to either assign it to <code>null</code> to initialize them using <code>new Type(..)</code>, classes like <code>String</code> and <code>Integer</code> are special cases that will be handled as following</p>\n\n<pre><code>String [] a = { \"hello\", \"world\" };\n// is equivalent to\nString [] a = { new String({'h','e','l','l','o'}), new String({'w','o','r','l','d'}) };\n\nInteger [] b = { 1234, 5678 };\n// is equivalent to\nInteger [] b = { new Integer(1234), new Integer(5678) };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In general you can create arrays that's <code>M</code> dimensional</p>\n\n<pre><code>int [][]..[] array =\n//  ^ M times [] brackets\n\n    {{..{\n//  ^ M times { bracket\n\n//            this is array[0][0]..[0]\n//                         ^ M times [0]\n\n    }}..}\n//  ^ M times } bracket\n;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It's worthy to note that creating an <code>M</code> dimensional array is expensive in terms of Space.
